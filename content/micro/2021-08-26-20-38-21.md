> The web is a continuum. It's like my old analog TV. It’s not exactly like DTV. Nor can it match it in some areas of functionality. It does, however, have other strengths. When digital TV fails, it fails completely. Analog TV, to use parlance of the web, degrades gracefully. The web could be similar, if we choose to make it so. It could be “the analog” web in contrast to “the digital” platforms. Perhaps in our hurry to replicate and mirror native platforms, we're forgetting the killer strength of the web: universal accessibility. --- [The Analog Web](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2017/the-analog-web/)
