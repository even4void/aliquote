Thanks to <https://archive.org>, the [CLRS textbook](https://archive.org/details/r-ita3e/page/n1) (3rd ed.) can be freely downloaded. One can also find the famous [Sedgewick's *Algorithms*](https://archive.org/details/PearsonAlgorithms4thEd.SedgewickWayne/page/n5). I found a PDF copy long ago, and it is dedicated by [Simon Plouffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Plouffe).
