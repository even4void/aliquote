Nice review of old and new text editors: [The Era of Visual Studio Code](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2020/09/21/the-era-of-visual-studio-code/).

> BBEdit, Emacs, and Vim are all great text editors in their own right, but they all have idiosyncrasies that (while beloved by people like me) prevent them from ever being the most popular text editor.
