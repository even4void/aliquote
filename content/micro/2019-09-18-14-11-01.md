While I'm really impressed with the [Eisvogel](https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template) template for my `Org->PDF` toolchain---the rendered listings remember me of the Nord theme that I use in my terminal and under Emacs or Vim), I'm also investigating other alternatives. Here are is a nice candidate: [arabica](https://github.com/periodicpoint/arabica), but that may well be too much for what I need. And I learned that there already was [some attempt](http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/12/05/opening-science---the-book/) at generating pretty HTML book via Pandoc/Jekyll before Hadley Wickham *Advanced R*.
