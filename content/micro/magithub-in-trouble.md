[Magithub](https://github.com/vermiculus/magithub/) (soon, [forge](https://github.com/magit/forge)) is now part of Spacemacs/[magit](http://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+source-control/github/README.html). No need to add further
configuration to your `init.el`. Today I was trying to send an issue for on one of
my repo and I figured out that there's [some trouble](https://github.com/magit/ghub/issues/81) at the moment. `#emacs`
