I reconfigured my almost defunct Gmail account into `mu4e`. The fact is that since I'm using `mbsync` instead of `offlineimap`, I was missing the `SubFolders Verbatim` option to allow `isync` to recognize those funny "[Gmail]/" IMAP paths (or what Google invented as folders, which are no real folders, etc.). Now I am ready to do another round of cleaning! `#emacs`
