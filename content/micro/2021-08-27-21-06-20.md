>  Mathematics has no side effects.

Math cannot modify the value of a variable--either global or local. It cannot mutate an element in an array. And, a mathematical function always returns the same value for the same input.<br> The literal rendering of mathematics into code cannot contain side effects.<br> Mathematics is a purely functional language. --- [Translating math into code](https://matt.might.net/articles/discrete-math-and-code/)
