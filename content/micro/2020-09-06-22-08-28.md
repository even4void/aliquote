How funny that Apple's (now hidden for such a long time) `~/Library` folder keep archiving old attachments from the Messages app. It's actually 2.5 Go large while I systematically delete most of the attached media once they're saved on my HD! I know it's good practice to keep a shallow copy of everything for the casual user --- in case things get deleted by mistake, you know, but while isn't there an option to delete old stuff like this in macOS preferences? `#apple`
