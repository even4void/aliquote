I migrated a bunch of stuff to keep Neomutt and Apple Mail in sync, and I still use mu to manage complex search in my maildir. Here are the results of the last `mu index` which accounts for the integration of listservers and digests directly into proper iCloud folders, in no more than 5s:

```shell
Â» mu index
indexing maildir /Users/chl/.mail -> store /Users/chl/.cache/mu/xapian
| indexing messages; checked: 14443; updated/new: 3103; cleaned-up: 4144
```
