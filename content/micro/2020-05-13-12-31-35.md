The rise of interest in VSC is pretty interesting, compared to that of Atom few years ago, although I'm a bit surprised that Emacs remains such a niche for programmers (and probably writers as well).

> Just kidding. It’s fine, but this performance-related pun is still a thing, unfortunately, because each of those editors eats more memory and CPU cycles than Sublime Text, and overall performance is not that good. Why? Because these editors are not exactly editors. These two are web browsers that were turned into text editors. --- Andrey Orst on [Text Editors](https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/posts/2020-04-29-text-editors/)
