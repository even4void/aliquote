> I had noticed that many of our live shows were ending really early: a couple times recently, the last band was done and we were closed by 10pm. That seems weird and wrong to me. Especially in the summer: who wants to show up at a night club while the sun is still up? "Why are we doing that?", I asked. Well, Devon did some research, and the answer seems to be, "Because everyone else is doing that too." --- [Wherein this is just a sleepy seaside town now](https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2024/04/16.html)
