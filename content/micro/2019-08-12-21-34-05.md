[Doom Emacs tweaks: Org Journal and Super Agenda](https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/doom-emacs-tweaks-org-journal-and-org-super-agenda/). Nice post on BSAG website, as always. I personally don't use Org agenda, although I keep a list of TODO items and web links in separate org files. I once started to keep a daily workbook, but I stopped after a few months. Maybe I should try again.  `#emacs`
