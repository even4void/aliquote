Ah, I just noticed that my Netflix account has been hijacked two hours ago.
Thanks Netflix for asking me to give you the 8 last digits of my credit card
just to confirm that it is me in order to delete my account without confirming
it by email! (I did not give them btw.) Goodbye _Black Mirror_ then.
