Today I was reading Jack Baty's latest posts and I noticed an interesting
[micro-post](https://www.baty.blog/2019/saving-time-with-emacs-or-not) about keyboard versus mouse usage.

> The stopwatch consistently proves mousing is faster than keyboarding.

I think this deserves two additional remarks. First, it depends on the task at
hand: For instance, even if I prefer reading email with Apple Mail I use mu4e
under Emacs because I find it more convenient for bulk actions like archiving or
deleting a bunch of messages. Think of it a little: You just have to use your
preferred movement keys or the arrow keys and strike a key, and it's all done!
Likewise, for text editing or interacting with an REPL, I found Emacs
keybindings much more powerful than any combination of custom Services or even
TextExpander, together with using a mouse. I believe Vim users would agree as
well. Second, this does not account for people not using a mouse at all. I for
one have always been very happy with Macbook trackpad, and I come a lot slower
when I have to use a mouse, notwithstanding the fact that it is very bad
practice for the elbow and wrist. For most movement, I use the trackpad and I do
not worry much about Emacs or Vim keybindings, because there I am faster with
the trackpad. Hence, we should better clearly state what actions are better
performed using a mouse before claiming than the mouse win over the keyboard.
