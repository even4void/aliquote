> I saved a personal, private backup of everything I've posted -- 3,794 posts, not including this one -- and then deleted it all except the first post.<br>First, the why: the internet never forgets, but that's not how people work. "I like to remember things my own way. How I remembered them, not necessarily the way they happened." The person who posted entries here ten years ago is a different person than me, and I see no reason for that older person to stay around*. --- [the end of livejournal](https://evan.livejournal.com/991055.html), by [Evan Martin](http://neugierig.org)
