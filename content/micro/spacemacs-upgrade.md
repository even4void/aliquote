Back to a fully functional Spacemacs, after a complete reinstall. Some minor
 annoyances with MELPA actually, but nothing serious; fixed a weird bug with the
 `ocaml` layer, since I learned that the `syntax-version` layer should come before
 `ocaml`, but otherwise everything is fine. Also, I'm trying to go all Helm
 instead of Ivy. `#emacs`
