Keeping away from Twitter was quite a nice idea. Instead of spending one hour browsing my TL everyday, I settled for a few minutes here and there, without any bookmarks. As a result, I read three books in three days, listen to some good vinyles in the morning, and I immersed myself in old books on algorithms and data structures. BTW we just started watching Chernobyl.
