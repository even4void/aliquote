> My overall feeling is that if I could spend infinite time and effort, my C programs would be as fast or faster than Rust, because theoretically there's nothing that C can't do that Rust can. But in practice C has fewer abstractions, primitive standard library, dreadful dependency situation, and I just don't have the time to reinvent the wheel, optimally, every time. --- [Speed of Rust vs. C](https://kornel.ski/rust-c-speed)
