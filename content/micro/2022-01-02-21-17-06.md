> It’s been my experience that our intuition of what is and isn’t a pathological or malicious input is about as accurate as time estimates. Requirements change and any and all attack vectors will be found and exploited. The mental burden of remembering the assumptions made to correctly check for pathological or malicious inputs in all cases and keep them updated during refactoring is far too enormous to successfully maintain. --- [Almost Always Unsigned](https://graphitemaster.github.io/aau/)
