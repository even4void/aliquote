> When you are a kind of old school, modern times means a bit of pain in some way. Your soul is mostly seeking inner peace but on the other hand, as someone that works with technology, you wouldn't stay freeze.<br> And sometimes the thing is the other way around, it feels that the old-school-world you're living with is good but not as great as it should and you need to move a bit forward yourself to - wrongly - have a feeling of progress. --- [Mattermost and Matterbridge](https://userlinux.net/mattermost-and-matterbridge.html)
