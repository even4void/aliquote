I was just reading [mu4e 0.9.18: E-Mailing with Emacs now even better](https://vxlabs.com/2017/02/07/mu4e-0-9-18-e-mailing-with-emacs-now-even-better/), and I
thought that I was a heavy user of mu4e too, but that was before they introduce
"contexts" and threaded views. I should really update my Emacs config. `#emacs`
