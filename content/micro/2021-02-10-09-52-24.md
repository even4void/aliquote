> Given what I just said, we Haskellers have a lot of hubris. Each time you say "if it compiles it works," a thunk dies and collapses into a blackhole. We've got plenty of messes in Haskell that don't sufficiently protect us from ourselves. The compiler can only do as good a job as our coding standards and our libraries allow. --- [Haskell: The Bad Parts, part 2](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/11/haskell-bad-parts-2/)
