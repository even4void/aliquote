I have the following Jupyter kernels installed on my HD:

```shell
Â» jupyter kernelspec list
Available kernels:
  python3                /Users/chl/.local/lib/jupyter/share/jupyter/kernels/python3
  clojupyter             /Users/chl/Library/Jupyter/kernels/clojupyter
  common-lisp            /Users/chl/Library/Jupyter/kernels/common-lisp
  racket                 /Users/chl/Library/Jupyter/kernels/racket
  wolfram                /Users/chl/Library/Jupyter/kernels/wolframlanguage14.1
```

I renamed clojupyter snapshot to something more convenient to handle when calling `jupyter console`. I'm using OpenJDK 24.0.1 from Homebrew (which I symlinked in macOS default `$JAVA_HOME`, using `sudo ln -sfn /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk`) and I kept getting this annoying warning:

```shell
WARNING: A restricted method in java.lang.System has been called
WARNING: java.lang.System::load has been called by org.sqlite.SQLiteJDBCLoader in an unnamed module (file:/Users/chl/Library/Jupyter/kernels/clojupyter/clojupyter-standalone.jar)
WARNING: Use --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED to avoid a warning for callers in this module
WARNING: Restricted methods will be blocked in a future release unless native access is enabled
```

To get ride of the warning, simply add `--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED` in the `kernel.json` init file.
