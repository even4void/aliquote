> Some developers won’t use an editor without a debugger, or linting, or Git built-in. For me, these aren’t hard requirements but are bonuses. Indeed, most good editors have these, or plugins that enable them. How useful they’re all depends on the language and platform you’re developing for. --- [Why Neovim is the best code editor / IDE for developers](https://console.dev/articles/neovim-best-code-editor-ide-for-developers/)
