And now we are halfway thru [The 100](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_100_(TV_series)>), Season 6. Mostly delayed because, you know, Apple TV, but it's right on the point and far less depressing than the news we are served every day after all. Next in the radar: The rest of [Black List](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blacklist_(TV_series)>) (starting from Season 5), and [The Expanse](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)>), Season 3 probably. BTW, someone's inclined to build an SVG graph [like this](https://leancrew.com/all-this/2020/03/daily-updated-covid-19-cases/)? No, just kidding, I can do it myself but am not really interested in doing so.
