Oh I guess [my remark](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr/issues/410) became totally useless since `lintr` 2.0.0 came out on CRAN recently. I should note that old options are still valid, though, so I can keep the following in my `init.el` file:

```emacs-lisp
(flycheck-lintr-linters
   "with_defaults(assignment_linter=NULL, camel_case_linter=NULL, commented_code_linter=NULL,
                  absolute_paths_linter=NULL,line_length_linter(120))")
```

Not that I am a big fan of camel case, but Bioconductor folks are apparently. `#rstats` `#emacs`
