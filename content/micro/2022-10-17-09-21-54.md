> Instagram users can only write plaintext without any formatting and it even doesn’t look nice on
the phone and you have to insert an image even in case you only want to post a message and you
know what? Nobody cares. I can only talk about russian speaking segment of the platform but the
amount of activity there is just crazy. People not only share cat photos there, but also buy and
sell stuff, write analytical articles, do workshops and trainings without any problem. The fact
that sometimes they have to literally edit the photo and put a text overlay on top of it (and it
often looks like some of the worst myspace examples) doesn’t bother anyone. And all the
communication is solved with a restricted instagram account or a closed whatsapp group. --- [From the basics to complexity and back](https://can3p.github.io//blog_draft/2022/10/14/no-html/)
