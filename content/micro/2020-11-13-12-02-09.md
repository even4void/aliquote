I've been sick for two weeks now: probably a rhinopharyngitis at the beginning, which evolved into sinusitis. It's getting better now, hopefully I'll be able to post stuff here and there. Nothing interesting on HN the past few days, I should probably go back to good old RSS feeds which I haven't check in days.
