Just when I was about to try out boosting and bagging in Stata ([rforest](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s458614.html) and [boost](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1536867X0500500304)), I realized that most programs now require Stata 15 or newer. Even Lasso penalization has been integrated in the core modeling facilities starting with Stata 18. At least, I can still run [lassopack](https://statalasso.github.io/) to perform  L1, L2 regularization or a combination thereof. They use the same convention as in glmnet, where the parameter $\alpha$ stands for the elasticnet mixing parameter ($\alpha=0$ corresponds to the ridge penalty while $\alpha=1$ is the lasso penalty). The authors compared Stata builtin and R regularized estimation, which is great: [Replication of glmnet and StataCorpâ€™s lasso](https://statalasso.github.io/docs/lassopack/lasso2_replication/). See also [An introduction to the lasso in Stata](https://blog.stata.com/2019/09/09/an-introduction-to-the-lasso-in-stata/) on the Stata blog. `#stata`
