A few days ago, I read a thread on [Biostars](https://www.biostars.org/) (which I haven't consulted in a
while) on the use of [Wolfram mathematica in bioinformatics](https://www.biostars.org/p/172862/), and I wondered why
people are so critical of this software. The same applies to Stata (if you see
the recent flame on Twitter, you know what I mean), albeit in this case there's
not even [this man](https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/) behind it.
