> I know a lot of people dislike semantic versioning. They hate how requires incrementing the major version number every time a breaking change is made.<br>
> I consider it to be a good thing.<br>
> You should pause and carefully consider making a change that will break people’s current code.<br>
> You should be ashamed if your project is at version 43.0.0 because you’ve made 42 breaking changes. That’s 43 times you’ve disregarded your users’ time! That’s a bad thing! --- [Volatile Software](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/04/volatile-software/)
