Today I listened to an old compilation of audio track (MP3) from the Velvet that I was burning twenty years ago. At that time it was kind of my collage period and I created many CD covers and photo montages. I felt sad to learn that the [Stile Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stile%5FProject), from which I had printed one of the images, is now completely defunct and the domain name is now hosting a porn website.
