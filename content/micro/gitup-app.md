I somehow forgot about [GitUp](https://gitup.co). A simple `git log` and more Magit when required, and
I'm generally done with tracking what I've done. Of course, this is because I
mostly work alone. Anyway, I like it when you have a such a clean and minimal UI
which helps to visualize at a glance (or even act on) a full Git repo.
