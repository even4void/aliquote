I'm trying to use Eshell more consistently since a few days. [Mastering Emacs](https://masteringemacs.org/article/complete-guide-mastering-eshell) is
(as always) quite useful in this respect. After having tried some custom
settings, including those found on [Modern Emacs](http://www.modernemacs.com/post/custom-eshell/), I finally choose the full-featured
[eshell-git-prompt](https://github.com/xuchunyang/eshell-git-prompt). `#emacs`
