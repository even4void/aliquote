[How to visualize decision trees](https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/index.html). A nice tutorial and overview of existing
solutions for visualizing decision trees. The illustrations are really of great
quality, as well as the [other articles](https://explained.ai). For other related projects, see, e.g.,
[A visual introduction to machine learning](http://www.r2d3.us), [Seeing theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu), or even articles
published on [Distill](https://distill.pub).
