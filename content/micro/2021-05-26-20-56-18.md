I'm delighted to start using Julia again. The 1.6 milestone, which may eventually becomes the next LTS version, looks much more stabilized than the previous versions I quickly tested in the past (1.0, and 0.3 to 0.5 beforehand). And, they got a true [graphical engine](https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/). `#julia`
