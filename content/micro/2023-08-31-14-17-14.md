Among many of the text-based UIs advantages, I found that the ability to copy-paste almost anything using Vim shortcuts via tmux or the shift+ctrl combo of my terminal emulator is one of my preferred. Here is an excerpt from my long-running (server side) Irssi session, as a tribute to Vim's creator:

```
