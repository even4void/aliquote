I was going to spent some times trying to output the sound of my built-in speakers to my old Apple TV which is connected via a DAC to my wi-fi system, until I realized it is as simple as loading Pipewire RAOP module, `pactl load-module module-raop-discover`. Then, launch pavucontrol and switch to your Airplay device.

The Airplay system is now listed in the list of available devices.

```

We can even make it the default output audio channel:

Now, since Pipewire supports multiple streaming output devices, much like mpd, I just need to configure the audio source in their config files to get everything right for the next time.
