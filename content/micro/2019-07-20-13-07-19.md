While I believe I'm still recoevring from the last episode of hyperkaliemia, my blood pressure seems ok, even if I feel a lot tired, at least more than usual. But as we have to be positive, let's face it: it's not too hot yet, I'm having a glass of white wine and enjoying a pleasant breeze, as I did yesterday.
