I was just reading some of [Rackhim](https://rakhim.org)'s posts. He's the author of the recent [EmacsCast](https://emacscast.org/about/).
The one on [backups](https://rakhim.org/2016/11/backup/) is quite interesting. I use [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com/) (Thx [@fonnesbeck](https://twitter.com/fonnesbeck)!) daily
since 5 years or so and I have been happy with that only one solution to backup
my personal and work-related data. I no longer use cloud fronts like Dropbox,
except for already anonymised stuff I don't get care enough to bother with privacy.
