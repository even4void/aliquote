I deleted a bunch of dead stuff on my OS (again): `clang8` and `gfortran`, probably installed for R, but I don't care since I already have the latest LLVM (10.0) and GCC (10.2) from Homebrew; [GPGTools](https://gpgtools.tenderapp.com), since I already have `gnupg` installed by Homebrew for Emacs among other things --- it took me some time to reconfigure everything the way it used to work beforehand, well, that's until I realized that there was a separate `pinentry-mac` package to store passphrase in OS Keychain. Meanwhile, I installed a FreeBSD image for VirtualBox, just to make sure I'll be ready the day I will have to leave the Mac world unless Big Sur doesn't turn out to be the same kind of catastrophic update Catalina did. `#apple`
