> Anyway, our point is if you’re going to read a Haskell manual for 10 minutes a day, you aren’t going to become a programmer even in a hundred years. But if you combine reading a manual with watching at least 10 minutes of video courses daily and doing 10 minutes of real coding each day for a couple of months, at the end you will be able to program something valuable in Haskell. --- [How to Learn Haskell in 10 Minutes a Day](How to Learn Haskell in 10 Minutes a Day)

Sure. Hopefully, I could benefit from the rest of my working days to learn ReasonML, Purescript & Co.
