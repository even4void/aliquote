Remember that paper from 2012 on Julia as a [Fast Dynamic Language for Technical
Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5145)? Now, Julia 0.6.2 is extensively described in this recent article:
[Julia: Dynamism and Performance Reconciled by Design](http://janvitek.org/pubs/oopsla18b.pdf) (PDF). Interestingly, Julia
relies on at least 6 different PLs. `#julia`
