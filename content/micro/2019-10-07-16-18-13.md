If you like reading about others' setup, *Uses This* has a nice interview with [Chris Wellons](https://usesthis.com/interviews/chris.wellons/). Apparently, there's also a [quick review](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8354) on Irreal. And so I learned that he now mostly uses [Vim](https://github.com/skeeto/dotfiles) and he also has a [live CD](https://github.com/skeeto/live-dev-env) in case he find himself away from his home computer.
