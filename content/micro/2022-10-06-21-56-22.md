[How to configure neovim to properly format python code?](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/37397/how-to-configure-neovim-to-properly-format-python-code). Simpler solution is to add this mapping to your `after/ftplugin/python.vim`: `nmap <buffer> g= :!black --quiet %<cr>:redraw!<cr>:!isort -q %<cr>:redraw!<cr>`. Not sure if we really need two `redraw`, but it works quite well. This could be put in an autocommand if we want to format on save, say. `#vim`
