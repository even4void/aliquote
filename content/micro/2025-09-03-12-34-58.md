If you installed the XCode command-line tools and you did notice there's no longer `/usr/local` on macOS, you probably want to add the following to your `after/ftplugin/c.vim` for `gf` to work properly on included headers:

```vim
setlocal path+=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include
```
