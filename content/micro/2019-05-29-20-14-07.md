[Your syntax highlighter is wrong](https://jameshfisher.com/2014/05/11/your-syntax-highlighter-is-wrong/). Interesting take on the importance of comments in code. This reminds me of the arguments advanced by [Nikita Prokopov](https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster) (aka tonsky) for developing his own color theme for various editors:

> Alabaster highlights comments. Most schemes try to dim comments by using low-contrast greys. I think if code was complex enough that it deserved an explanation then itâ€™s that explanation we should see and read first. It would be a crime to hide it.
