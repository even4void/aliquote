After today's quick testing, it looks like [Wolfram Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/WolframResearch/WolframLanguageForJupyter) is working as expected under Quarto (see this blog post for a previous [attempt with Stata](post/stata-quarto/)). The Racket kernel works as well (minor caveat, you'll probably have to [symlink your Homebrewed libzmq](https://github.com/rmculpepper/iracket/issues/20)).
