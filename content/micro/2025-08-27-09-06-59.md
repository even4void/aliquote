Now playing from Apple Music right into Tmux status line!

Put this script somewhere in your `$PATH`:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
unset title

title=$(osascript -e 'if application "Music" is running then' -e 'tell application "Music" to get name of current track' -e 'end if')
artist=$(osascript -e 'if application "Music" is running then' -e 'tell application "Music" to get artist of current track' -e 'end if')

if ${title+"true"}; then echo "$artist â™ª $title"; fi
```
<small>If you don't mind using the `-e` switch as your line separator; otherwise just write a `.scpt` file and load it directly.</small>
