Put this script somewhere in your `$PATH`:

```shell
#!/bin/sh

title=$(osascript -e 'if application "Music" is running then' -e 'tell application "Music" to get name of current track' -e 'end if')
artist=$(osascript -e 'if application "Music" is running then' -e 'tell application "Music" to get artist of current track' -e 'end if')

printf "%s • %s\n" "$artist" "$title"
```
<small>If you don't mind using the `-e` switch as your line separator; otherwise just write a ` switch as your line separator; otherwise just write a `.scpt` file and load it directly.</small>
