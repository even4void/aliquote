Now playing from Apple Music right into Tmux status line!

![img](/img/2025-08-27-09-06-55.png)

Put this script somewhere in your `$PATH`:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
unset title

title=$(osascript -e 'if application "Music" is running then' -e 'tell application "Music" to get name of current track' -e 'end if')
artist=$(osascript -e 'if application "Music" is running then' -e 'tell application "Music" to get artist of current track' -e 'end if')

if ${title+"true"}; then echo "$artist â™ª $title"; fi
```
<small>If you don't mind using the `-e` switch as your line separator; otherwise just write a `.scpt` file and load it directly.</small>

See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/even4void/b207c1e402fd7787e00e6685f843aee1) for a more elaborated solution that accounts for both Cmus and Apple Music.
