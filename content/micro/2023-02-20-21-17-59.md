The highest upvotes I got on Cross Validated is for a quick reply where I mentioned the Gifi "nom de plume", which I miss a lot. Enjoy your "unfinished" retirement, Mr./Dr. [Jan de Leeuw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_de_Leeuw), and happy [*foo*metrics](https://aliquote.org/cours/2011_health_measures/03-psychometrics_screen.pdf) (PDF)!

> If Foo is a science then Foo often has both an area Foometrics and an area Mathematical Foo. Mathematical Foo applies mathematical modeling to the Foo subject area, while Foometrics develops and studies data analysis techniques for empirical data collected in Foo. Each of the social and behavioural sciences has a form of Foometrics, although they may not all use a name in this family. --- de Leeuw, 2006
