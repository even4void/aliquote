TIL about [Witch](https://manytricks.com/witch/), by the designers of Moom:

> Switch Everything
>
> The built-in macOS app switcher is great if all you use are one-window applications. But you probably have many windows open in many apps, possibly with many tabs, and navigating them all is a pain. Enter Witch, with which you can switch everything.
