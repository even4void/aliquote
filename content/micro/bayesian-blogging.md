[Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) is still on my reading list (I know the second edition is
ready to be sold but I bought the hard copy of the first edition two years ago),
but I was reminded of Richard's nice blog posts like [Markov Chains: Why Walk
When You Can Flow?](http://elevanth.org/blog/2017/11/28/build-a-better-markov-chain/), thanks to [@kaz\_yos](https://twitter.com/kaz%5Fyos/status/1086967755692277760).
