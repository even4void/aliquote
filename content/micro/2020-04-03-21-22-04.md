[Linear Algebra Done Right](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-11080-6), by Sheldon Axler, is available for free as well. Idem for [Bayesian Data Analysis](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/BDA3.pdf) (3rd ed.), but see the [GH repo](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto). Happy readings and stay safe!
