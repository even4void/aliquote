Just updated my Julia binary to v1.0.1. BTW, the [online manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/) is a valuable and very polished ressource to learn the language. I hope to find more time to dwelve into the latest iteration of the language since I stopped using Julia around v0.4 or 0.6. `#julia`
