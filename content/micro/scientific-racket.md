I am looking for solid libraries to perform numerical computation (other than
the [Science Collection](http://planet.racket-lang.org/package-source/williams/science.plt/3/1/planet-docs/science/using.html) which has been partly integrated already), and more
generally scientific computing, using Racket. I got a few hits from my search
engines but this is mostly old and unmaintained stuff (e.g., [racket-ml](https://github.com/danking/racket-ml),
[data-science](https://github.com/n3mo/data-science)). This [SE thread](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1454/using-unconventional-programming-languages-for-scientific-computation) is worth a read although the replies mainly point
to Julia. BTW, note that Tamas K. Papp stopped using CL for scientific
computation (and also switched to Julia) for [specific reasons](https://tpapp.github.io/post/common-lisp-to-julia/). `#scheme`
