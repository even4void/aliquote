I wanted to get rid of raw `<img>` tags and replace then with `<figure>`, available as a [shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure) in Hugo. It turned out I had a lot of replacements to perform:

```shell
Â» rg -nc "\!\[.*\]\(" content/post | cut -d: -f2 | paste -sd+ | bc
688
```

Here's a classical one-liner using Sed:

```shell
sed "s/^\!\[.*\](\(.*\))/{{</* figure src=\"\1\" */>}}/ content/post/*.md
```

I took the opportunity to add a small colored insert to each figure using the following CSS code:

```css
figure {
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 .5em #f3f3ed;
  margin: 2em 4em;
}
```
