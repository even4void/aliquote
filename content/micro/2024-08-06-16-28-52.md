I wanted to get rid of raw `<img>` tags and replace then with `<figure>`, available as a [shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure) in Hugo. It turns out I had a lot of replacements to perform:

```shell
» rg -nc "\!\[.*\]\(" content/post | cut -d: -f2 | paste -sd+ | bc
688
```

Here's a classical one-liner using Sed:

```shell
sed "s/^\!\[.*\](\(.*\))/■/" content/post/*.md
```
<small>Correct replacement pattern (■) reads `figure src=\"\1\"`. Unfortunately, adding the shortcode delimiters would make Hugo think it's a real shortcode that it should render as is -- and [this trick](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/solved-how-to-make-hugo-ignore-shortcode-delimiters-e-g-when-used-in-code-blocks/6045) no longer works.</small>

I took the opportunity to add a small colored insert to each figure using the following CSS code:

```css
figure {
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 .5em #f3f3ed;
  margin: 2em 4em;
}
```
