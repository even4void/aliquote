Magit lets you reword a previous commit message so easily (compared to interactive rebasing solutions that are suggested all over StackOverflow). In a magit status buffer, just `r w`, select the commit, fix it, then `C-c C-c`. This is even better than the [earlier solution](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/22565) offered by the author. Interactive rebasing is also a joy. `#emacs`
