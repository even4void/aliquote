Here is a handy script to automagically create and edit a new Hugo post from a Terminal:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    set -e
    cd ~/Sites/aliquote
    POST="$1"
    DATE=`date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S'`
    if [ -z "$POST" ]; then
      read -p "Filename: " POST
    fi
    if [ "$POST" = "now" ]; then
        POST=$DATE
    fi
    hugo new "micro/$POST.md"
    cd -
    (
        sleep 0.2 && vim "$HOME/Sites/aliquote/content/micro/$POST.md"
    )

I've put this in my `~/local/bin` directory, which is in my `$PATH`.
