TIL about [theme.sh](https://github.com/lemnos/theme.sh) which is amazing: no dependency, self-contained, and it can be used online without setting up anything in your bashrc or zshrc config. You can not only preview colorscheme using Fzf, but you can also import your own colorscheme (it will be added in `theme.sh` itself. See also Foot FAQ to implement [dynamic color changes](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/wiki#dynamic-color-changes). `#unix`
