> In reply to this criticism one is normally reminded that Unix was invented for a PDP7, which had about as much memory as an earthworm and CPU power to match. That is, the user interface was designed to minimize the time required to decode a command. That meant short, fixed-case, commands, and no minimum matching. But 1969 is a long time ago, and both memory and speed have improved a thousandfold since then. --- [A Requiem for a Dying Operating System](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~blj/funny/requium.html)

Still, I like short command names like `rm` or `ls`.
