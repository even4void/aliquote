> The benefit of a form, is that one no longer needs to use a mouse or some awkward key combinations to painstakingly select a region of code first, before sending it out for evaluation. Instead, one can use a single key stroke that means "evaluate the form under the cursor", or "evaluate the form before the cursor", etc, to precisely define the scope and send the code at the same time. --- [How much can a Clojure developer do alone? ](https://yyhh.org/blog/2021/03/how-much-can-a-clojure-developer-do-alone/)
