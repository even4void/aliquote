> Python is not built with math and statistics in mind, and this doesnâ€™t work without using a package.

If you're looking to move from R to Python, here are two interesting posts: [Python is Weird (an unabashedly biased intro to Python for R users)](http://www.ericrscott.com/2018/05/03/python-is-weird/); [Programming with Data: Python and Pandas](https://github.com/dgerlanc/programming-with-data). The first one, from which the above quotation is extracted, provides a side-by-side comparison of some of the features of each language. You might like or not, since R is a DSL and [Python is not a good PL to compare](http://f.briatte.org/r/r-as-a-data-science-language). The second one is a complete tutorial on Pandas (including linear regression) in IPython notebooks. Besides, Chris Albon's [Technical Notes On Using Data Science & Artificial Intelligence To Fight For Something That Matters](https://chrisalbon.com/machine_learning/vectors_matrices_and_arrays/transpose_a_vector_or_matrix/) are also worth a look. `#python`
