> Joy Division raised desolation to the level of high art, and they covered plenty of stylistic ground while doing so. They could be severe: "Warsaw" is punishing, three-chord punk, bitter and mean. They could be chilly: "Heart and Soul" dwells in an ice cavern of echo. And they could be desperate, as on "Something Must Break"--a harrowing glimpse into the darkness that would be the band's undoing.
