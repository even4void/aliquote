Well, I [finally updated](https://aliquote.org/micro/2019-08-21-21-01-39/) my config for Doom Emacs, which now relies on [straight](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el) to manage all packages. The first upgrade was quite buggy, but once I figured out I could just delete my current `.emacs.d` and start from scratch again, I got a working install in a few minutes. Beware that the process of downloading and configuring all packages is quite long. You will also likely need to update your autoloads, e.g., `doom refresh -f`. Also, if you have a problem rebuilding the pdf-tools viewer, eval this before running `pdf-tools-install`: `(setenv "PKG_CONFIG_PATH" "/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/Cellar/libffi/3.2.1/lib/pkgconfig")`. `#emacs`
