It’s not going to put me out of a job. This is from 2017 but still relevant as of today.

> At least 75% of the actual job of programming is figuring out what a person means when they ask for something. This is not a problem that a machine can solve for you, for the same reason that it’s harder to build a robot that builds other robots than to just build a robot. Have you had words with Siri lately? Do you think Siri is in a good position to understand your intent, or it’s maybe just searching for command words in a limited lexicon? Do you really think it could find Henry’s stool? Or does it seem more likely that it would get confused and require a human… trained to translate… high-level human-language… into language suitable for… the machine?
