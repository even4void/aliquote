[Literate Programming using Scribble](https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/lp.html) (or maybe [literify](https://github.com/kflu/literify/tree/master)?) would be a very nice alternative to [Org babel](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/index.html) if only other PLs were supported, IMHO. `#org` `#scheme`
