[Typing is not the problem](https://macwright.org/2015/01/19/typing-is-not-the-problem.html). Nice take! This came just after reading Tom's [last
post](https://macwright.org/2019/03/28/oss-at-scale.html), where I also learned about [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/). The latter reminds me
that at some point I was using some ideas from [Modern Emacs](http://www.modernemacs.com/post/pretty-magit/) to highlight commit
leaders.
