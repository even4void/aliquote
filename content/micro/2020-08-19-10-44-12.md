Trying out [Borg](https://www.borgbackup.org) as a quick backup solution for my dot files and maildir. It turns out that compression mode can be optimized a bit by playing with the settings (for my maildir, `--compression auto,lzma,6` increased compression rate by about 30%). I'm looking forward to see how it goes with incremental updates.
