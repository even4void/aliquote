[JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) looks like a nice new monospace font, with support for ligature (like Fira Code). Yet, it is far less condensed than Inziu Iosevka, and after more than one year of using Iosevka in Emacs and iTerm I became quite used to it. Here it is, from left to right: Menlo, Iosevka, and JB Mono. (Click to enlarge)
