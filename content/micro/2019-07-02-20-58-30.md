Last week I discovered an interesting side-effect, or bug to put it simply, in Emacs/LSP (I'm using Doom Emacs but I don't think it is relevant here). The LSP package has a nice utility to show code outline in a sidebar (much like the goold old `imenu-sidebar` that was once available in Doom Emacs). Together with NerdTree (or Treemacs if it suits you better), you get the same look'n feel as what's available in VS Code or Atom. Now, what if I tell you that once I activate the LSP package, you get code outline for free in all other modes, including Lisp or Racket? `#emacs`
