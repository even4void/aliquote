I have been using my bluetooth [Magick Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/fr/shop/product/MLA22F/A/magic-keyboard-fran√ßais) at my office since 3 weeks now, and it's kinda difficult to write on the Macbook built-in keyboard right now. Or I may just be tired. Anyway, to reiterate what I was saying [last year](/post/mb-keyboard/), this is definitely a very good keyboard.
