[Dropbox silently installs new file manager app on usersâ€™ systems](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/07/dropbox-silently-installs-new-file-manager-app-on-users-systems/). That's a shame as I always thought of Dropbox as a reliable and solid alternative to iCloud or other backup/sync toolchains. I removed all my folder long ago, and I no longer make any use of my 15+ Go free space, but the recent issues with Dropbox are appalling. Let's hope they will find a good compromise like when decided to update their TOS and then bring a step backward.
