> Most developers are primarily engaged in making systems that acquire, extract, transform, maintain, analyze, transmit and render informationâ€”facts about the world. Most often, this information documents some human activity, be that of customers, suppliers, advertisers, travelers, voters, members, students, patients etc and must deal with all the irregularity thereof. This is in stark contrast to artificial systems, e.g., programming language compilers, which make up their own rules, in fully enumerated spaces, can eliminate irregularity and can reject anything which does not conform. --- [A history of Clojure](https://clojure.org/about/history)
