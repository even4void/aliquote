> [I]n biology, when one research team publishes something useful, then other labs want to use it too. Important work in biology gets replicated
all the time—not because people want to prove it’s right, not because people want to shoot it down, not as part of a “replication study,” but just because they want to use the method. So if there’s something
that everybody’s talking about, and it doesn’t replicate, word will get out. --- [Biology as a cumulative science, and the relevance of this idea to replication](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/03/04/biology-as-a-cumulative-science-and-the-relevance-of-this-idea-to-replication/)
