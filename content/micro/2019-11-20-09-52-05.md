I spent a couple of hours building the full Haskell stack (aka [haskell-ide-engine](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine)), with `stack`. (This was possible after I realized an old `cctools` from Homebrew was causing trouble all along.) I ended up with a 8+ Gb `.stack` directory, for a few command-line executables that now sit in my `.local` directory. Now, [how](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/133) do I clean up things? Enjoy! `#haskell` `#emacs`
