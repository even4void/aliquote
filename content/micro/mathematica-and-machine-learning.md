[Mathematica implementations of machine learning algorithms used for prediction
and personalization](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaForPrediction).

> This open source project is for Mathematica implementations of statistical and
> machine learning algorithms that can be used for data analysis, prediction, and
> recommendation systems.

Note that the Github repository also includes Lua, Java and R code. The
companion website is [Mathematica for prediction algorithms](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com).
