Best way to learn about recent (non-breaking) changes in [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is to rerun your old R code. Now I know that :

```
Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0. Please use `linewidth` instead.
The `<scale>` argument of `guides()` cannot be `FALSE`. Use "none" instead as of ggplot2 3.3.4.
```

Other than that, I found that the `theme_minimal()` is as good as the `hrbrthemes:theme_ipsum`. Less dependencies, clear and elegant graphical output.
