I just updated my Doom Emacs, which was 10 weeks old. Of course, I had to start from scratch since the upgrade process failed miserably. Great news: they switched to [MS Python LSP](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-python-ms), which is supposed to be better than the default LSP. BTW, the material icon fonts may fail to install properly, so be sure to check it is right into `~/Library/Fonts` in case you see strange icons in your modeline. `#emacs`
