> In December, in my article When dropping support feels like sabotage, I was complaining that Apple was limiting the support of security updates to just the two previous versions of Mac OS, and not extending such support to even older versions like High Sierra or Mojave given the amount of people that are still using them. But I was forgetting that on iOS the situation is even worse. --- [â†’ No more security updates for iOS 14](http://morrick.me/archives/9475)

Lovely, `#apple`. I'm still on Mojave and iOS 12.5 ;-)
