It looks like [Elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed) is way more handy than it was, thanks to [elfeed-org](https://github.com/remyhonig/elfeed-org) to
handle OPML files.

> As far as I know, outside of Elfeed there does not exist an extensible,
> text-file configured, power-user web feed client that can handle a reasonable
> number of feeds. The existing clients I've tried are missing some important
> capability that limits its usefulness to me.

Note that Spacemacs uses the key combination `g r` to update the live feed, not `G`
as mentioned in Chris' [tutorial](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2013/09/04/). `#emacs`
