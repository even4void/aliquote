I finally got this "rounded upgrade", or macOS 26. As someone who spend almost all the day in a Terminal, it's pretty okay since I'm only exposed to changes made to the menu bar (Dock has always been hidden on my laptops, and I don't store files or folders on the Desktop). Safari 26 was no longer working with comact mode on Sequoia 15.7 (no way to interacti with the address bar other than with using keyword shortcuts). The floating buttons and panels are a minor inconvenience on most apps I use, but still it's a drastic shift in macOS UI. Maybe this is becuase I still own a very old iPhone with a very outdated iOS, or maybe this is just me, like many others. Also, they revamped the nifty [volume icons](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/rip-to-the-macintosh-hd-hard-drive-icon-2000-2025/) we used to have on the Desktop. At least we got a useable Spotlight again. `#apple`
