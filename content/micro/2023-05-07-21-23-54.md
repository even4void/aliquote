I will probably watch _Millenium_ again, and I thought I need to watch Noomi Rapace's recent movies. Seven sisters (which is not listed on his filmography on Wikipedia) was so great after all. I watched [Close](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_(2019_film)>) two days ago; quite bad, actually. [Bright](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright_(film)>) was better, though.
