Logistic regression is not fundamentally a classification algorithm.

> The problem arises from logistic regression often being taught as a “classification” algorithm in the machine learning world. I was personally not taught this way– I learned from econometricians that you can use either probit or “logit” as general linear models in the event you want to estimate on a binary target variable, and that these models calculate probabilities. Thinking about logistic regression as a probability model easily translates to the classification case, but the reverse simply does not seem to be true. --- [Why Do So Many Practicing Data Scientists Not Understand Logistic Regression?](https://ryxcommar.com/2020/06/27/why-do-so-many-practicing-data-scientists-not-understand-logistic-regression/)
