I see this [pandoc LaTeX template](https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template/blob/master/README.md) popping out on Twitter yesterday. I remember
trying it out at some point when I was looking for some good hand crafted
templates for R/statistical reports. At that time, many people were also using
the [Metropolis](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) theme for building slides. I wrote custom templates for both
situations, finally.
