[The value of owning more books than you can read](https://t.co/SKZFqqbNKe). I have thousands of books in my home, many of which are more than 20 years old. From time to time it seems to me that's all I have left. I've read them all except the last ones I bought. However, I can understand what it's like to contemplate all that we still have to learn.
