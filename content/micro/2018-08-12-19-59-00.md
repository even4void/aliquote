Reading [The Concrete Tetrahedron](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783709104446). "In most stages of our discourse, the book by Graham, Knuth, and Patashnik can be used as a reference to many additional techniques, applications, stories, etc. However, the present book is not meant to be merely a summary of “Concrete Mathematics.” We have a new twist to add to the matter, and this is computer algebra." (See John D Cook's [review on MAA](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/the-concrete-tetrahedron).)
