[What is the ideal blog post length for SEO?](https://www.wesfed.com/blog/ideal-blog-post-length-seo/). I will have a hard time publishing only 1500 word long blog posts, but I'm no SEO and I believe it all depends on the target audience. For instance, I like reading short to medium length posts on John Cook or Irreal blogs, but I also enjoy more lengthy discussions on Caches to Caches or Evan Miller's weblog. Sometimes it just depends on my mood, or the available time. However, it may happen that at some point I only want to ready a bunch of short posts, which is still more refreshing than browsing my Twitter TL some day.
