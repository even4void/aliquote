Even if I have only increased the length of my working days by 2 hours in 1
month (currently 9am to 3pm), I definitely stay out of work for a good 2 or 3
hours once I get home. I guess I just have to live with that for the moment.
It's probably time to finish [Occupied](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/tv-season/occupied-lint√©grale-des-saisons-1-2-vost/id1339687553) before the beer finishes me off. `#self`
