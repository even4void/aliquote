I tried them all (recently, Ghostty, for a day). My preferred terminal emulator was probably foot, back when I was on Linux.

```shell
Â» ls .config/archived
alacritty/         ghostty/           kitty/             matterbridge.toml  tig/               zed/
foot/              helix/             lazygit/           psql/              wezterm/
```
