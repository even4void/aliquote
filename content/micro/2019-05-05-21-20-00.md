This is not the first time that I come across some king of ASCII- or OpenGL-based generative art using SBCL*, but [@inconvergent](https://twitter.com/inconvergent/status/1124713400427327488)'s work is amazing. Check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/inconvergent/snek) as well if you like this kind of stuff. `#lisp`

* E.g., [flax](https://github.com/sjl/flax/) by [Steve Losh](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2018/08/a-road-to-common-lisp/#pick-an-editor), who happened to be on a Twitch coding session today, btw.
