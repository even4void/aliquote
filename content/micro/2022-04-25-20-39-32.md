> I don’t think it was a big technical innovation (it’s obvious that you want to separate a language-agnostic editor and a language-specific server). I think it’s a rather bad (aka, “good enough”) technical implementation (stay tuned for “Why LSP sucks?” post I guess?). But it moved us from a world where not having a language IDE was normal and no one was even thinking about language servers, to a world where a language without working completion and goto definition looks unprofessional. --- [Why LSP?](https://matklad.github.io//2022/04/25/why-lsp.html)
