TIL about Racket `curry` and [`curryr`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/procedures.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Ffunction..rkt%29._curryr%29%29), a higher-order function which returns a [curried](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) version of a given procedure. When the arity is known in advance, e.g. 2, this amounts to `(define (curry f) (Î» (x) (Î» (y) (f x y))))`. As an application, think of converting string to their equivalent representation as ASCII values:

```racket
(define (string->num s)
  (define base (sub1 (char->integer #\A)))
  (map ((curryr -) base) (map char->integer (string->list s))))
```
