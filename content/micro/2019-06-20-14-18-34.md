Just came across [this post](https://vxlabs.com/2018/11/19/configuring-emacs-lsp-mode-and-microsofts-visual-studio-code-python-language-server/) again, and I dig a bit about MS own LSP. Although it would be cool to have an LSP as powerful as that of VS Code, the [installation steps](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-python-ms) are a little discouraging. And since the default LSP that I used in Doom Emacs has been enhanced a lot (it no longer hang on with Python code, for example), I think I will deal with factory settings. `#emacs`
