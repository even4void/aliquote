> I don't tap my own phone. I don't xerox postcards before I mail them back from vacation. I don't take a voice recorder when I go out with friends. And I don't have a copy machine at home to duplicate hand written notes I may send. --- [The cost of saving sent e-mail](https://mark.stosberg.com/the_cost_of_saving_sent_e-mail/)

I do like having local copies, both of my handxritten notes and of my sent e-mails. Digital nomadism, with one foot in the analog world.
