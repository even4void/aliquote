[Can you make a basic web app without googling?](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/webappwithoutgoogling.html). I still can write a complete website using HTML and basic CSS without looking at Google (or DuckDuckGo for what matters). Likewise, I can use Sed, Awk and shell scripts, or write R and Python code without relying on a search engine. However, I must admit that I became so lazy over the years that I found myself googling for everything nearly available in the help, man or info pages that sit on my computer. That's a shame, of course. Laziness and muscle memory are the problem. We should probably refrain ourselves from googling again and again. That's not a way to learn.
