TIL about [dumb-jump](https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump) (via [Irreal](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8307)), an Emacs "jump to definition" package for 40+ languages. I became quite used to LSP jump-to- definitions and references, until I realized today that `dumb-jump` is included in [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/tree/develop/modules/tools/lookup) toolbet! `#emacs`
