[Centaur Emacs - A Fancy and Fast Emacs Configuration](https://seagle0128.github.io/.emacs.d/). Not interested in
switching from Spacemacs, but in case someone like fancy modeline. (Note that
[doom-modeline](https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline) is now part of Spacemacs default settings, at least the develop
branch.) `#emacs`
