Flat is a good thing but at some point I wish there could be a way to avoid unecessary duplication of core frameworks. I mean, below you'll find that I need 4 versions of the Qt goodies that I don't even use on my system.

This all results in several Gig of wasted space, IMO. But this probaby is the way to go, as far as containerization is concerned.

```shell
Â» du -sh /var/lib/flatpak
11G     /var/lib/flatpak
```
