I try to use all the features of fzf-lua, and it's quite easy to reproduce a Git time machine with the `bcommit` command. If you're not, you may want to give a shot to [git-time-lapse](https://github.com/junkblocker/git-time-lapse): It does the job pretty well with zero dependencies (e.g. Telescope, plenary), and it can be installed as a simple optional plugin. `#vim`
