I'm slowly removing all unnecessary apps on my Macbook. Just so in the end I'll be living in the dark age of terminal mode. Last removal: [Reeder](/post/reeder-app/). Since I needed Feedly to sync my feeds between my Macbook and my iPhone, I just find it easier to read blog posts on Feedly directly.
