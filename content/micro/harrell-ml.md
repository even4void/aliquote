Frank Harrell started hosting [his own blog](http://www.fharrell.com/) several months ago, and I followed
his posts once in a while, that is almost every time I see something new on
Twitter. His [last annoucement](https://twitter.com/f2harrell/status/1066351423443664896) is about a talk he will give at the Johns Hopkins
Department of Biostatistics, which appears to be a mix of his [latest posts on
this topic](http://www.fharrell.com/tags/machine-learning/). I wish I could attend his talk as I did for his RMS workshop in
Ottawa some years ago.

Please note that my [last tweet or retweet](https://twitter.com/chlalanne) is from October. Don't expect any
other news from me--I will only bookmark tweets that I found interesting while
the liking option is still available. If the "like" feature is going to
disappear, then it means I will definitely forget about Twitter.
