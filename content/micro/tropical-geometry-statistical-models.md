[Tropical geometry of statistical models](https://www.pnas.org/content/101/46/16132.abstract). At least, the conclusion is very
understandable:

> The algebraic representation for graphical models with hidden variables leads
> naturally to an interpretation of a parameterized model as a point on an
> algebraic variety. Marginal probabilities are coordinates of points on the
> variety. Varieties can be tropicalized, and the statistical meaning is that the
> MAP prob- abilities (calculated with logarithms of the parameters) can be
> interpreted as coordinates of points on the positive part of the tropical
> variety.
