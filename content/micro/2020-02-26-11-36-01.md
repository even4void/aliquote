> This is terribly wrong. Everything the Finder displays should be correct all the time. If, for some technical reason, it doesnâ€™t know the size of something and needs to wait, it should show a spinner or some other indicator that you, the user, need to wait to get the information. The actual file size of a folder is what you want to see, and ideally you should see it as soon as you ask for it. --- [What You See in the Finder Should Always Be Correct](https://daringfireball.net/2020/02/what_you_see_in_the_finder_should_be_correct)
