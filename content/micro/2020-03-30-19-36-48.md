The "advantage" of confinment is that I now have a decupled time for reading from the comfort of my own home, listening to music I like and enjoying the nice wether (from behind the windows most of the time, but I have a small balcony that allows me to get some fresh air and possibly have lunch outside whenever I want). Social distancing isn't a big deal, since I haven't seen much of the world for a long time now. `#self`
