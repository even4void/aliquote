I've been pretty quite these past few days. It might even be a little longer if I don't get back to writing online. Part of this distance comes from the fact that, first, I had to deal with side-effects of my medications; second, I've spent too much time fighting useless things; and, third, I have no obligation to publish anything anyway, which in a way suits me a lot (I keep writing on my paper notebooks, though).
