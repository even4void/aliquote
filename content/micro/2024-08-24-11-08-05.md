Some really nice Gnome extensions are landing on GitHub, see [openbar](https://github.com/neuromorph/openbar?tab=readme-ov-file) and [forge](https://github.com/forge-ext/forge). See also [Exploring the Default Tiling Windows Feature in Ubuntu 24.04 (and Enhancing it)](https://itsfoss.com/ubuntu-tiling-windows/). I still have [Tactile](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4548/tactile/) around, but I rarely used it these days, unless I'm mirroring my desktop on a larger screen. `#unix`
