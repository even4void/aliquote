Ubuntu Dock completely hidden now, which makes for a cleaner desktop!

```shell
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock autohide false
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock dock-fixed false
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock intellihide false
```

I also installed the [Suckless terminal](https://st.suckless.org/), as a popup terminal always opened on second workspace, with semi-transparency enabled thanks to [Luke Smith](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st)'s patch and no border ([Stein Gunnar Bakkeby ](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/blob/master/st/st-no_window_decorations-0.8.5-20220824-72fd327.diff)'s path). I can launch Cmus without messing my current Tmux workspace, and forget about it.
