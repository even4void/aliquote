Want to test your competitive programming skills? Take a look at this Bachelor's
Thesis: [Analysis and solution of a collection of algorithmic problems](https://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2117/113325/memoria.pdf) (by Rafael
Eusebio López Martínez).

> In competitive programming, one has to use knowledge in algorithms and data structures to find solutions to algorithmic problems, then put those a ideas into a correct computer program that solves the problem within given time and memory constraints. This activity involves learning about a wide range of complex data structures and algorithms, and many hours of training.
