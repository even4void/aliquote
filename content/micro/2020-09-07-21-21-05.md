[My thoughts about editors in 2020](https://phaazon.net/blog/editors-in-2020). That's an interesting take on text editors in the 21st century. I remain a strong Emacs believer, although I tried and loved (Evil) modal editing. Work in progress.

> However, the Vi philosophy is probably too obscure for me at the moment. It has been going on for at least 10 years so I have little hope that it will ever change. While I like some ideas we found in modal editing, I cannot embrace them all. [Emacs, 15 years later](/post/emacs-15-years-later/)
