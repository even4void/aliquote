Euler problem 14 is all about Collatz numbers. I am aware of Atabey Kaygun's [post](https://kaygun.tumblr.com/post/170044995839/collatz-sequence-yet-again)[s](https://kaygun.tumblr.com/post/110103741384/collatz-type-conjectures-continued), but I found a [nice implementation](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41080733) in Scheme on SO today.
