> Rust has also mostly replaced Go as my go-to language for writing small performance-sensitive programs, like the numerical simulators I use a lot. Go replaced C in that role for me, and joined R and Python as my day-to-day go-to tools. I've found that I still spend more time writing a Rust program than I do Go, and more than C (except where C is held back by a lack of sane data structures and string handling). I've also found that programs seem more likely to work on their first run, but haven't made any effort to quantify that. --- [Two Years With Rust](http://brooker.co.za/blog/2020/03/22/rust.html)
