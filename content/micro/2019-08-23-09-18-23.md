Just noticed this [thread on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20766443), in which [UglyToad](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=UglyToad) complains that only 2-3 hours are really productive in a day. I can relate, since I observed the same pattern when working as an applied statistician: 3 hours (one burst) for writing code, that's only what I was able to do in a day; hopefully, I could benefit from the rest of the day to write statistical reports and process emails! It also reminds me of Chris Done's report on his weekly activity on Github for a particular project: there was a clear pattern of high intensity the first three days, then a progressive decrease in the number of commits starting on Thursday up to Sunday. (Unfortunately I can't get my hands on this post.)
