I wish I had read this earlier when I stopped myself using [Textmate](/post/emacs-versus-textmate/): [Coming Home to Vim](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/). The discussion around Vim philospohy for modal editing (verb, noun and adjective) is quite on the point. See, I'm not against Vim itself--I use it to edit those posts, btw--but we need to agree to make some compromise for [editing purpose](/post/emacs-15-years-later/).
