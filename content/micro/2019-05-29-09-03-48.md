[The reason I am using Altair for most of my visualization in Python](http://fernandoi.cl/blog/posts/altair/). I can understand the why -- I too find that Matplotlib is not that good when it comes to statistical graphics, and that's why I used to use R, Stata, Gnuplot or even Mathematica for that purpose. That being said, Altair like D3js are great but they require much more work compared to statistical packages. That's why DSLs are important. `#python` `#dataviz`
