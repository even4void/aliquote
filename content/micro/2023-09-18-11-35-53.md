It appears that Neomutt can be quite slow when filtering/searching emails using body keyword or patterns and the "limit" (`l`) command. It seems that Neomutt needs to open all emails beforehand, which makes sense but slow down any search operation. Now, as suggested in [#3273](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/3273), we can speed up things a lot by disabling the `auto_view text/html` feature. My benchmarks confirm those of the poster, with around 13K messages in my Archives. I don't know how to disable auto_view temporarily, but since I can use `mu-find` to search my email database, with almost the same syntax, I do'nt have to worry much: results are almost instantaneous!

```
macro index \Cf "<shell-escape>mutt-mu " "mu find"
macro index gf  "<change-folder-readonly>~/.mu/results<enter>" "mu find results"
```

<small>Here, `mutt-mu` is a short shell script for `mu find --clearlinks --format=links --linksdir=~/.mu/results "$1"`.</small>
