[What's New in Neovim 0.11](https://gpanders.com/blog/whats-new-in-neovim-0-11/). I upgraded via Homebrew some weeks ago and didn't notice any breaking changes. However, after reading this article, I tried to setup my LSP configurations via the new facilities, and it works like a charm: `root_dir` has to be replaced with `root_markers`, and the `filetypes` parameters is equivalent to the basename (e.g., `filetype.lua`) that I put in my ftplugin directory. It is much easier to manage basic autocompletion via `omnifunc`. I don't use virtual text and I don't really care about virtual lines either, but it looks great. I revamped some of my custom mappings since Neovim now ships with default meningful keymaps for goto actions. `#vim`
