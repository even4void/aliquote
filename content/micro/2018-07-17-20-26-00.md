TIL "Rather than showing a continuous probability distribution, [Hypothetical Outcome Plots (or HOPs)](https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/hypothetical-outcome-plots/) visualize a set of draws from a distribution, where each draw is shown as a new plot in either a small multiples or animated form." I didn't know this technique had a name. `#dataviz`
