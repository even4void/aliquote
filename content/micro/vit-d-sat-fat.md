Ok, hold on! It looks like [Vitamin D](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1809944) may not have so much an impact on cancer,
heart disease, or stroke (via [John Gruber](https://www.outsideonline.com/2380751/sunscreen-sun-exposure-skin-cancer-science)'s blog). Likewise,
[saturated fats](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27680091) may not be so much associated to CVD (via [Daniel Lemire](https://lemire.me/blog/2019/01/12/science-and-technology-links-january-12th-2019/)'s
blog). Great news! Sall we simply replace vitamin D supplements with porn
burgers?
