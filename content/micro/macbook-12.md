I'm in my third year with the [12-inch Macbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook%5F(2015–present)) (generously offered by SB). It is
certainly the best laptop I got in 13 years. Sometimes I feel like I miss the
tiny pulsing light (aka sleep indicator) that we used to have on older metallic
aluminum body ones. Well, we have backlit keyboard now, even if it is like a
butterfly keyboard ;-)
