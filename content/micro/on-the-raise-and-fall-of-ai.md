A few months ago I read an [interesting](https://macwright.org/2018/02/25/remember-the-winter.html) post by Tom MacWright on the raise and
fall (and raise again) of AI. Now, I came across the following thread that
sounds like we also need to consider [RL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement%5Flearning), which I learned about twenty
years ago. Go figure.
