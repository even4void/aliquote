Just curious so I installed the [datatable](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/getting-started-with-python-datatable/notebook) Python package. I've been very happy with R `data.table` package so I hope it will not be too difficult to switch over Python. BTW, the [h2o.ai](https://www.h2o.ai) team is doing great things for data science. `#python`
