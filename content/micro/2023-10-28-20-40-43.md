> This document is a sort of [quine](https://everything2.com/?node=quine). If you select the whole page in your browser and paste it into a file, this text shows up encoded in a weird [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) variant embedded in a string literal inside a [Racket lisp](https://racket-lang.org/) script. Evaluating the file with `racket -f $FILE` evaluates the lisp, converting the weird Markdown and producing the same HTML document that your browser received. --- <https://cgad.ski/>
