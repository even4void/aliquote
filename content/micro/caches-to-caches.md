I've been following [Greg Stein](http://gjstein.com) on [Caches to caches](http://www.cachestocaches.com) for a long time now, because
the site has such a [beautiful design](http://www.cachestocaches.com/2015/8/technologies-behind-caches-caches/) and useful material on Emacs and Org mode.
Recently they published a series of [posts on AI and ML](http://www.cachestocaches.com/category/machine-learning/).
