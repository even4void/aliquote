[Reduce vs fold in Common Lisp](https://www.n16f.net/blog/reduce-vs-fold-in-common-lisp/): Interestingly, R whihc is often referred to as a Scheme-like language has `Reduce` as one of its higher-order function, but no fold[lr] functions in base. [Modeling Data With Functional Programming in R](https://cartesianfaith.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/rowe-modeling-data-with-functional-programming.pdf) (whole book available in 2024 maybe?) looks like an interesting take on this topic. `#rstats` `#lisp`
