Nice finding today! Just when I thought I would need to write a full macOS
native app for viewing Fasta files or MAFFT-aligned sequences, I found it
[already exists](https://github.com/4ment/seqotron), and it's so much faster and prettier than [Jalview](http://www.jalview.org). Thank you so
much [Mathieu Fourment](https://4ment.github.io/)! `#bioinfo`
