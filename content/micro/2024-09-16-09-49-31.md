> All mainstream, general purpose programming languages are (basically) Turing-complete, and therefore any programme you can write in one you can, in fact, write in another. There is a computational equivalence between them. The main differences are instead in the expressiveness of the languages, the guardrails they give you, and their performance characteristics (although this is possibly more of a runtime/compiler implementation question). --- [Why Haskell?](https://www.gtf.io/musings/why-haskell)
