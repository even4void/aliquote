[Computer Science from the Bottom Up](https://www.bottomupcs.com/).

> Not everyone wants to attend shop class. Most people only want to drive the car, not know how to build one from scratch. Obviously any general computing curriculum has to take this into account else it won't be relevant to its students. So computer science is taught from the "top down"; applications, high level programming, software design and development theory, possibly data structures. Students will probably be exposed to binary, hopefully binary logic, possibly even some low level concepts such as registers, opcodes and the like at a superficial level. <br>
> This book aims to move in completely the opposite direction, working from operating systems fundamentals through to how those applications are complied and executed.
