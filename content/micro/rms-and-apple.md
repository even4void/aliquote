RMS is now [taking care of Apple](https://stallman.org/apple.html). Now, I can't help but smile at the idea of this
picture where we see RMS carrying his laptop on his shoulder. Surely he wasn't
listening to music on iTunes. Note too that the list of criticisms made of
Microsoft is much shorter (fair enough), but the same is true for Google who
only gets two dozzns of bad marks! `#apple`
