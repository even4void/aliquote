> Wavefunction Collapse is a very independent-minded algorithm, and needs almost no outside help or instruction. You feed it an example of the vibe you’re going for, and it figures everything else out for itself. Despite this self-sufficiency, it is surprisingly simple. It doesn’t use any neural networks, random forests, or anything else that sounds like machine learning. --- [The Wavefunction Collapse Algorithm explained very clearly](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/17/wavefunction-collapse-algorithm/)
