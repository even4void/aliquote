> Iterated random functions are used to draw pictures or simulate large Ising models, among other applications. They offer a method for studying the steady state distribution of a Markov chain, and give useful bounds on rates of convergence in a variety of examples. The present paper surveys the field and presents some new examples. There is a simple unifying idea: the iterates of random Lipschitz functions converge if the functions are contracting on the average. --- Iterated Random Functions, by Diaconis and Freedman

Sounds already good to me.
