It's been 10 years that I subscribed to GitHub (and a little less to Bitbucket), and I'm slowly rewriting (yet another time) and uploading my past lecture notes to public or private external repositories (`--theirs` in git parlance). That's quite an exhausting fucking life, isn't it? I hope I will done for good with my past (life) after all that...
