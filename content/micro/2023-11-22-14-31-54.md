> My general advice for maximizing the battery is only use your battery as much as you need, i.e. charge it as often as possible, and as little as possible. If you need a rule of thumb, stay within 30%-80%. [Wouldn't charging a lithium battery to 80% only defeat the purpose of putting the battery into longer use in the first place?](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/623375)
