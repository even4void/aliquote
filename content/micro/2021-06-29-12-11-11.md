TIL about [lieer](https://pypi.org/project/lieer/), which can be used to fetch and two-way tag synchronization between notmuch and GMail. I no longer really use Gmail, and I use mu instead of notmuch to manage my Maildir's, but this is quite nice. See [Setting Up neomutt with notmuch, gmail(lieer) and gpg signing](https://uttarayan21.github.io/posts/setting-up-neomutt/#lieer-gmail) for additional information.
