To put it briefly, human experience is characterized by Dasein (a technical term for Heidegger that can be translated literally as “being-there” or “being-here”), which tends to overcome spatial distance through meaningful action or symbolic understanding, to bring even the world close to itself, a tendency that Heidegger calls de-severance. With various modern technologies, however, this tendency of Dasein is made more complicated. --- [A Phenomenology of Spotify and Vinyl](https://hedgehogreview.com/web-features/thr/posts/a-phenomenology-of-spotify-and-vinyl)
