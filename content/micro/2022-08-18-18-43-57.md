> The way I look at it, the apps themselves are the workspaces. On a smaller screen I usually full screen everything and on larger display scenarios, I have nearly everything laid out in front of me so I really just want to be able to switch between apps as fast as possible. --- [How I GNOME or Why I Don't Use a Tiling Window Manager by Josh Sherman](https://joshtronic.com/2018/09/09/why-i-dont-use-a-tiling-window-manager/)

That's the conclusion I reached as well on OS X and Ubuntu when I started (re)using native window manager facilities. This remains so even after me trying i3 then Regolith, since Tmux can do a lot of tiling too, and the only thing I really need is to have apps maximized on screen, or split vertically (who need to fully split a 16:10 or 4:3 laptop screen horizontally these days?).
