> This difficulty is often not due to math - because of the aforementioned frameworks machine learning implementations do not require intense mathematics. An aspect of this difficulty involves building an intuition for what tool should be leveraged to solve a problem. This requires being aware of available algorithms and models and the trade-offs and constraints of each one. --- [Why is machine learning 'hard'?](https://ai.stanford.edu/~zayd/why-is-machine-learning-hard.html)
