> Yes, make Emacs appealing and user friendly. But don't forget that a masterful tool in the end requires mastery, which can't come for free. I certainly draw the line at saying Emacs is for everyone. I'm not saying it's only for some sort of snooty "elite" but I am saying that it's for those who are willing to learn, seeing some extra work as the aforementioned long-term investment, and who have the patience reach a worthy goal a little later rather than right this very minute. --- [Making Emacs popular again](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/819452/1480c3a59d3d9093/)
