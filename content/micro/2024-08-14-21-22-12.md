Yet another round of computer cleansing today. I also removed VirtualBox since I can certainly manage everything with qemu, and lot of unused Gnome garbage that I installed for testing purpose. Ironically, I also uninstalled [Gapless](micro/2024-07-25-09-44-52/) since I always returned to Cmus with which I am so comfortable and which fits my TUI workflow so perfectly. `#unix`
