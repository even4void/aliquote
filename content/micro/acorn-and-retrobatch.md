I don't have any big needs in terms of image processing, and I am generally
happy with ImageMagick. However, [Acorn](https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/) and [Retrobatch](https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/) (h/t [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com/2019/02/06/retrobatch-node-based-image-processing/)) look
pretty nice.
