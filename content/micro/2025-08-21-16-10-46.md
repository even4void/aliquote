[Mavericks Forever](https://mavericksforever.com). This reminded me that I still have my old [MacBook Pro](/post/os-x-mavericks/) from late 2013, which came with Mavericks pre-installed. I ended up my Apple journey with [Mojave](/post/osx-mojave/) running on a [Macbook 12‚Äù](post/setup-2018/), which has always been my preferred version of OSX, and one of the best laptop I used to use over the years. Now the MBP is waiting for Ubuntu to upgrade thousand of packages (I haven't used it for two years now) before I perform a `do-release-upgrade`.
