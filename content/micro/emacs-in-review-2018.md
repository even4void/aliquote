A few days ago, while reading RSS feed for the [irreal](http://irreal.org/blog/) blog I found the following
nice post: [Emacs in 2018: My Year in Review](https://diego.codes/post/emacs-2018). Although my first thought was that
the author was using Spacemacs, it is indeed vanilla Emacs with a specific
modeline, which is actually built using [minions](https://github.com/tarsius/minions) and [moody](https://github.com/tarsius/moody). See also [Beauty lies
in the segments of the mode line](https://manuel-uberti.github.io/emacs/2018/03/10/moody-and-minions/). `#emacs`
