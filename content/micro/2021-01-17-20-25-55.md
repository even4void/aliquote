What you need on Sunday evening when you're looking for a specific file in your "Papers" directory:

    alias bibfind="bibtex-ls ~/org/references.bib \
      | fzf --multi --ansi \
      | rg -o --color never '[a-z0-9\-]+$' \
      | xargs -I % sh -c 'fdfind % ~/Documents/papers' \
      | xargs -I % sh -c 'xdg-open %'"

Note that this requires [fzf-bibtex](https://github.com/msprev/fzf-bibtex), [rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), but the later two can easily be replaced with the standard Ì€`grep` and `find` tools.
