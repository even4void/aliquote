Diving into computational molecular biology. It's a fun world after all,
especially compared to medical statistics. I am trying to devise a reliable
workflow for taking notes and using a live notebook, mostly inspired from my [old
setup](http://aliquote.org/post/notes-taking-workflow/), but basically it's all about Org files with tags and "TODO items",
including a diary and `helm-bibtex` for managing my bibliography. Nothing fancy,
but it just has to do the job right after all.
