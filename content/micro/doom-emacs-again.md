According to [BSAG](https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/back-to-doom-emacs/), Doom Emacs has been polished a little in recent months. I'm
still on Spacemacs--probably for a long time to come--but I remember how
pleasant the [experience](/post/doom-emacs/) [with Doom Emacs](/post/org-and-bibtex/) was. `#emacs`
