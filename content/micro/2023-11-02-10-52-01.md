I generated a docset for Purescript with [pursuit.docset](https://github.com/SEIAROTg/pursuit.docset). However, I'm skeptical about its added value. I'm using Dash docset in Neovim via [vim-dasht](https://github.com/sunaku/vim-dasht), and I noticed that oftentimes the online help for simple query like `filter` or `partition` are pretty vague. E.g., in the case of `filter` the very first hits are all about `_filter :: forall r a. Lens' { ... } a`, while none of the first matches for `partition` yields the same result as a simple query on Pursuit (`filter :: forall a. (a -> Boolean) -> Array a -> Array a`).
