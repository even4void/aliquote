Until now when reading my feeds using [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/), I was simply filtering unread feeds, sorted by count using a dedicated keybinding (`bind-key S rev-sort`, which allows me to simply press `Su` to get the desired output). Now, I learned about `l` which filters unread feeds. It is quite handy since it acts as a filter and the list of unread feeds empties itself as you read articles.
