The more I use or read about Common Lisp, the more I see subtle reincarnations into statistical languages like R (`eval` and `quote`, of course) or Stata (`foreach` and `forvalues`, close to `dolist` and `dotimes`). I barely use Stata or R nowadays, but Lisp dialects still have a bright future ahead, and there are so much to learn. `#lisp`
