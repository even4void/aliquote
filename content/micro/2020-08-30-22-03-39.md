I intended to write a brief post some years ago after he retired. I didn't, but there's this [Festschrift for Jan de Leeuw](https://www.jstatsoft.org/issue/view/v073) on the JSS. It was great to meet him at [Rennes](/post/the-6th-carme-conference/), even if I was too shy (which I believe is just my latent Asperger's syndrome) to engage in a conversation with him. I remember the time where I subscribed to his mailing list on statistical computing ("StatCompute Digest"), and the `.mac` shared point he used for his `/usr/local` resources. That was a great time. I learned a lot from the man. He's definitively [not retired](http://deleeuwpdx.net/publication/poly/). Thank youi, Jan.
