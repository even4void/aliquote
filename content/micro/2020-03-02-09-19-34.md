> Clojure is (slowly) eating the world. Honestly, we should be thankful that the language continues to grow despite being fairly unorthodox, compared with the current norm of typed functional languages and the massive sea of object-oriented code that’s out there.  It’s also the odd child in the Lisp family with its functional, data-driven, and interop-heavy approach to programming. --- [Clojure: the Lisp that wants to spread](https://simongray.github.io/essays/spread.html)
