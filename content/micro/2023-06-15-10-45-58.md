> In my view this isn't about adhering to the XDG standard[3], it's about getting things out of \$HOME. Unix dotfiles were always a (somewhat accidental) hack[4], and over the years we've accumulated entirely too many of them in our \$HOMEs. The XDG option isn't particularly perfect, but it's at least a standard approach and it achieves the goal of getting dotfiles out of \$HOME. As a side effect the XDG approach makes things more legible if you look in ~/.config. --- [Where your program's configuration files ('dotfiles') should go today](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/DotfilesWhereToday)
