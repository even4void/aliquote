On a related note (re. Twitter, not decentralized social networks), I recently reduced the number of people I was tracking (1200+) to less than 390 and my timeline has become much more readable. I believe the noise was mostly coming from too much RTs from folks I followed once for some interesting threads but whose own tweets flow did not last over time. My own centers interest have surely evolved as well. Apologies for those I've unfollowed and still follow me on Twitter. I can't promise I'll come back someday, but you have this micro-blog in the meantime.
