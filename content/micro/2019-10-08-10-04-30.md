Well, I find it weird that Apple products are [more expensive in France](https://lemire.me/blog/2019/10/07/the-price-of-a-macbook-air-worldwide/). Conversely, I experienced a lot of trouble with taxes when buying Stata books from the US. Anyway, I no longer can afford any Apple product by myself, so I guess I'll have to keep my finger crossed in hoping that my current Macbook will last a few more years. `#apple`
