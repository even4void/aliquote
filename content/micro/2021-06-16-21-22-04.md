> The problem with most of these comments is that they convey very little information. Often it is just a repetition of the method name and parameter names in a few more words. These comments may be useful for API:s exposed externally, but in an application where you have access to all the source code, they are mostly useless. If you wonder what the method does, or what the valid input range for a parameter is, you are better off just reading the code to see what it does. These types of comment take up a lot of space without providing much value. --- [On Comments in Code](https://henrikwarne.com/2021/06/15/on-comments-in-code/)
