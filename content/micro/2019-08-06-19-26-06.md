I didn't read *The Book of Why*, but I heard of it a lot on Twitter lately. As you may know, I'm a big fan of Stephen Senn's work, and I keep following his posts here and there even if I'm no longer being involved in medical statistics. Here is another nice dicussion of [Lord's paradox](https://errorstatistics.com/2019/08/02/s-senn-red-herrings-and-the-art-of-cause-fishing-lords-paradox-revisited-guest-post/amp/?__twitter_impression=true), where the author explains why neglecting random effects may affect the conclusions drawn from a study. If you're interested in causal modeling of pre-post study, take a further look at this recent paper: [Causal Graphical Views of Fixed Effects and Random Effects Models](https://psyarxiv.com/cxd2n/).
