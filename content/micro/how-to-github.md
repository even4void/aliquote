Just found what I think is one of the best concise tutorial on "[How to GitHub](https://www.gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request)"
if you are looking to collaborate on a common repository. As always, it works
best when you read the [Magit manual](https://magit.vc/manual/magit/) and check what's available there.
