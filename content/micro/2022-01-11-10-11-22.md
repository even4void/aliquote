While browsing GitHub, I noticed that the [nvim-lua](https://github.com/nvim-lua) organization offers a "starter kit" `init.lua` file for Neovim users. It is a single Lua file, which is quite handy when you want to quickly bootstrap a sane config on external servers. I tested it in my own environment and it's pretty good actually. If you are new to Neovim, and especially Lua config files, I recommend taking a look at how this file is organized. Except for a few packages (theme and snippets), and the default key mappings, you will likely find a working setup for your daily editing tasks. I like the idea of having a single file for the whole config, although I can understand why we may want to split our whole config in separate files, which is actually what I do.
