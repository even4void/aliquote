Hardly working @home, for the moment. Just reading and checking emails, occasionally. I have lot of ideas for the blog, I know I need to do some biostats again -- it looks to me like it's just a matter of time until I launch a Twitch channel about _applied biostats from the command-line_ if confinment persists. Yet, I could also keep reading litterature artwork as usual.
