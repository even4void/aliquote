I guess when you have some time to spare on a Sunday evening, you can just push a bunch of commits using the wrong `user <email>` values (probably updated by SourceTree that I just relaunched for the first time two days ago), right? In this case, [this](https://help.github.com/en/articles/changing-author-info) was very helpful. For fancier version, see [How to change the commit author for one specific commit?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/3042437)
