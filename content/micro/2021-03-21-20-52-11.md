Meanwhile, I've been playing with OpenBSD a bit more, and guess what: Kitty terminal emulator is available there too. I'm impressed by the number of packages that are readily available: Kitty, Neomutt and Neovim work right out of the box. I wish Linux (Ubuntu) was using `/usr/local` as the default user directory for local programs, this would simplify config files a lot! `#unix`
