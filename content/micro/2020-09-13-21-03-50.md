> Longer functions contain more code, and the more code developers write the more mistakes they are likely to make.<br> But wait, the evidence shows that most reported faults occur in short functions.<br> This is true, at least in Java. It is also true that most of a Java programâ€™s code appears in short methods (in C 50% of the code is contained in functions containing 114 or fewer lines, while in Java 50% of code is contained in methods containing 4 or fewer lines). It is to be expected that most reported faults appear in short functions. --- [Impact of function size on number of reported faults](http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2020/09/06/impact-of-function-size-on-number-of-reported-faults/)
