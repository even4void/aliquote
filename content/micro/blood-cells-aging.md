Interesting read. (via [Daniel Lemire](https://lemire.me/blog/2019/02/09/science-and-technology-links-february-9th-2019/))

> Though we age, it is unclear how our bodies keep track of the time (assuming they do). [Researchers claim that our blood cells could act as time keepers](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.12897). When you transplant organs from a donor, they typically behave according to the age of the recipient. However, blood cells are an exception: they keep the same age as the donor. What would happen if we were to replace all blood cells in your body with younger or older ones?
