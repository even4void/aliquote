Trying out mpd in combination with [ncmpcpp](https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp) as a replacement for my long-time friendly TUI Cmus. I"m still in the process of discovering the functionalities. Everything seems okay on the mpd side -- I even got MPRIS support after reading the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Music_Player_Daemon/Tips_and_tricks) ([this](https://strugglers.net/posts/2023/ncmpcpp-a-modernish-text-based-music-setup-on-linux/) Go solution didn't work for me). I'm just looking for a direct way to listen to my music library without resorting on virtual playlist in ncmpcpp.
