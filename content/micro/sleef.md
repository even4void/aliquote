[SLEEF: A Vectorized Math Library](https://sleef.org).

> It implements vectorized versions of all C99 real floating point math

> branches and scatter/gather memory access.

It looks interesting even if I am not going to use it any time soon. (Other than
the short vector math library [available in clang](https://twitter.com/fsfodx/status/1066471314532257792)).
