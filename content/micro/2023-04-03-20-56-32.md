Trying out [J](https://jsoftware.com/)!

```
Â» jconsole
   comb=: [:;(,.&.><@:>:@;\.)^:(i.@>:@-~`[`(1:<@i.@{.~<:@-,2:))
   2 comb 3
0 1
0 2
1 2
```

Reading answer [like this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73944783) makes me think I should have spent more times with J when I first discovered it years ago.
