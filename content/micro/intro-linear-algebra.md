Added to my reading list: [Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/vmls.pdf) (PDF, 473 pp.).
Note that it also comes with a [Julia companion textbook](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/vmls-julia-companion.pdf). (h/t [@carlcarrie](https://twitter.com/carlcarrie/status/1073835210880499712))
