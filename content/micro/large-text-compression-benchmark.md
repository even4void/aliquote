An analysis of lossless data compression programs: [Large Text Compression
Benchmark](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text.html). (via [SO](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/q/1)--it looks it is the very first question on the beta site)

> The amount of genomic sequence data being generated and made available through
> public databases continues to increase at an ever-expanding rate. Downloading,
> copying, sharing and manipulating these large datasets are becoming difficult
> and time consuming for researchers. We need to consider using advanced
> compression techniques as part of a standard data format for genomic data. The
> inherent structure of genome data allows for more efficient lossless compression
> than can be obtained through the use of generic compression programs. We apply a
> series of techniques to James Watson's genome that in combination reduce it to a
> mere 4MB, small enough to be sent as an email attachment.
