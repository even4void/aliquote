Updating my global dist for the newly released v1.1 of [Julia](https://julialang.org). Installing
packages is much easier (e.g. [Gadfly](http://gadflyjl.org)) and smoother compared to the preceding
versions (prior to v1). Only caveat is that rendering plot via Gadfly is kind of
slow, especially compared to other graphing engines (R, Gnuplot, Mathematica, or
even Stata). `#julia`
