Hacky way to get `gf` works with Hugo rooted inline links (e.g., `/post/bla/`):

```vim
setlocal includeexpr='~/Sites/aliquote/content'.substitute(v:fname,'/\$','','g').'.md'
```

I've tried several combination of `path`, `suffixesadd` and `includeexpr` with no success, so I ended up with this ugly harcoded combinaion of root path and extension as prefix and suffix. `#vim`
