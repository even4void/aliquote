It's been more than a month now than the interactions I have with my Macbook can be summarized to using Emacs (or Neovim) and Zsh in a Terminal (with 24 bit color enabled) and, optionally (more often than I would like), Firefox or Skim to read PDFs. It's been relaxing, at least. Digital minimalism, plain text mode; I like it.
