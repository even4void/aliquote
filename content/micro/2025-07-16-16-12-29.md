Since I haven't looked back at my Neovim config for months, except for fixing occasional deprecations or API changes, I'm just reviewing how past projects evolved over time. I noticed that Lazyvim no longer relies on telescope but is now using fzf, which is great. It looks like [Blink](https://cmp.saghen.dev/recipes) is the new rockstar for auto-completion. I only use builtin Vim stuff, but it looks nice. `#vim`
