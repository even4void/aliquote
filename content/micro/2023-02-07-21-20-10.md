I just made my GH [biostats](https://github.com/even4void/biostats) public, just so you know how I like playing with translating R code to other languages, without any hope of finishing this new side project anytime soon. Details in this longer [blog post](/post/biostatistical-methods/). Want some crazy plots? Go to the `figs` directory in each language and compare the output. Be aware this is highly work-in-progress, as advertised on the GH repo, and there are many bugs lying around. Anyway, no more raw Matplotlib for me, I felt in love with [plotnine](/post/python-plotnine/).
