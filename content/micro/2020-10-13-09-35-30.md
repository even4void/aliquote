> In March I bought a 16" MacBook Pro, reasonably well tricked out: 2.3GHz 8-core Intel i9, 32G RAM, Radeon 5500M with 8G, 4T of disk. I hate it. It is slow and buggy enough that I wonder if maybe itâ€™s a lemon? Herewith the gripes, for no particular reason other than it makes me feel like shouting at the world. --- [I Hate My MacBook](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/10/02/I-Hate-My-MacBook)
