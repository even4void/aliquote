[Python VS Common Lisp, workflow and ecosystem](https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/pythonvslisp/). Really nice review, and I was happy to find a reference to one of Steve Losh's very nice post: [A Road to Common Lisp](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2018/08/a-road-to-common-lisp/). `#lisp`

> As you learn Common Lisp and look for libraries, try to suppress the voice in the back of your head that says “This project was last updated six years ago? That’s probably abandoned and broken.” The stability of Common Lisp means that sometimes libraries can just be done, not abandoned, so don’t dismiss them out of hand.
