I finally got ride of most of the (Neo)vim packages I was only using on an occasional basis, which led me to the following setup: (I barely use Rust, but I happen to read some Rust code from time to time.)

```shell
~/.config/nvim
» tree -L 3 pack
pack
└── plugins
    ├── opt
    │   ├── conjure
    │   ├── haskell-tools.nvim
    │   ├── nvim-lightbulb
    │   └── rustaceanvim
    └── start
        ├── fzf-lua
        ├── nvim-treesitter
        ├── nvim-treesitter-textobjects
        └── vimtex
```

Also, I deleted my custom colorscheme, even if I was just using [zenbones](https://github.com/zenbones-theme/zenbones.nvim) for the past few months, and I switched to the builtin `quiet` colorscheme, which is great (pending some minor changes which I implemented in an `autocommand`). Good-bye [orgmode](https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode) as well, especially since I don't use the agenda and capture stuff. `#vim`
