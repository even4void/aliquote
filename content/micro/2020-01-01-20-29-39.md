Can someone explain to me why on earth macOS devs thought it would be good to fetch again and again software updates instead of storing them in a hash list? I start to be really annoyed by those perpetual reminders to update my Mac, notwithstanding the fact that I need to wait for the pref pane to be up and ready. Each time. `#apple`
