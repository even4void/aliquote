> I install very few things on either my personal or work computer. I don’t have terraform, aws, node, or pip installed, but I use them all the time. I have a Docker image for each, and I run them in containers with minimal privileges. I’m definitely not the only one, but it’s not as popular as it should be. None of these tools actually need full access to my computer to do their work, but that is normally how they’re run. --- [Run More Stuff in Docker](https://jonathan.bergknoff.com/journal/run-more-stuff-in-docker/)
