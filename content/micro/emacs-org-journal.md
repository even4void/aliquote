I am still unsure how best to use [org-journal](https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal). I already use a "diary" file
where I bookmark important stages of my working day. This way, I get a nice
summary with `org-agenda`. Obviously, I could do exactly the same using
`org-journal`, but I was thinking that it could also be used to record my posts on
the main site: (1) I would be writing using Org mode directly, (2) I would get a
searchable archive from Emacs directly (and more convenient than `deft`), and (3)
that would be just cool. `#emacs`
