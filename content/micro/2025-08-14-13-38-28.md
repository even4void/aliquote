Apparently, external evaluation cells in Wolfram 14.3 are in trouble with personal `.Renviron` file. If I remove mine, everything goes well, otherwise I get a permission issue with renv. My `$HOME/.Renviron` only modifies the path for renv cache:

```shell
R_LIBS_USER="~/.local/lib/R/library"
R_PROFILE="~/.config/R/Rprofile"
RENV_CONFIG_USER_PROFILE=TRUE
RENV_PATHS_ROOT="~/.cache/org.R-project.R/R/renv"
```

Once R virtual environment is created, I can reinstate my personal config file, and everything is okay, but I guess next time if an R expression that requires to install external dependencies I will face a similar issue. Otherwise, external evaluation cell and the whole `ExternalEvaluate` stuff looks pretty interesting.
