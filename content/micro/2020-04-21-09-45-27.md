I've been lately retrying Atom: Atom IDE and the rest of Facebook's stuff is really in a sad mood apparently (Rust is ok but Haskell is a 2nd class citizen all along; Nuclide terminal's not working), Hydrogen still works great but you need to update kernel specs for Python 3. I guess I will just return to my usual stuff in Emacs. BTW, this is a great read if you're looking for an alternative to Hydrogen and/or Nteract: [Cheap polyglot notebooks](https://lepisma.xyz/2016/11/02/org-babel/). `#emacs`
