I've been using part of [mini.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim) last year but for now I'm just loading the completion module. I noticed there's an increased number of modules developed since last time I checked. I warmly recommend those modules if you want something light, easy to install and to setup. `#vim`
