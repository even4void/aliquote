> I don't know coding at all anymore. Most of the code I write is in my e-mails. So somebody sends me a patch ... I [reply with] pseudo code. I'm so used to editing patches now I sometimes edit patches and send out the patch without having ever tested it. I literally wrote it in the mail and say, 'I think this is how it should be done,' but this is what I do, I am not a programmer. --- Linus Torvalds, on [Slashdot](https://linux.slashdot.org/story/19/11/03/2230223/linus-torvalds-im-not-a-programmer-anymore)
