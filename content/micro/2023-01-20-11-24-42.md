As a sequel of this [old post](Archiving my responses on StackExchange) of mine, here is the [complete archive](/pub/stackexchange-stats.html) of the 467 answers I provided on Cross Validated during ten years or so. Note that this a raw (unedited) HTML, with many tiny bugs along the way, mostly related to Unicode encoding and missing images from imgur. I can probably with the UTF-8 issue by using a different processor than [htmldoc](https://www.msweet.org/htmldoc/). As for the latter, I believe the issue comes from Pandoc, since I retrieved a larger number of images manually using curl (tarball [archive](/pub/archive_416.tar.gz)).
