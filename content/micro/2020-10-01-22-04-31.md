I'm halfway thru Season 2 of [Fargo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(TV_series)). Like [True Detective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Detective), each season is independent from the preceding one. I didn't like True Detective S2 (probably because I very much liked S1) so I quit after the first episode. Likewise, I find Fargo S2 far less intriguing than S1. I will probably stop after that one.
