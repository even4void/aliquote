[Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate) "helps you create beautiful, intelligent, responsive API documentation." It
reminds me of the whole stack of [racco](https://rtomayko.github.io/rocco/rocco.html) (probably dead), [docco](http://ashkenas.com/docco/) (sill live) & Co.
Slate is used in [Clojure by Example](https://kimh.github.io/clojure-by-example/#about), a site that offers an original and very
instructive approach to learning the basics of the Clojure language.
