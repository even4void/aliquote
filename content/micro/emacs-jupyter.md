I don't really like editing code in a browser. This is why I rarely use Jupyter
notebooks. Likewise, I found that the Emacs [EIN](https://github.com/tkf/emacs-ipython-notebook) package was clunky. This was
years ago, and I don't think the project has evolved so much in the recent
years. TIL there's a new interface to communicate with Jupyter kernels:
[emacs-jupyter](https://github.com/dzop/emacs-jupyter). `#emacs`
