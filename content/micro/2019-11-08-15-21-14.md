> To riff on an idea from Alan Jacobs, a blog can be a kind of gardenâ€”perhaps one that is well-tended, or perhaps one that is gone a bit wild and overgrown, but either way a place where the structure is organic and emergent as much as it is planned. Even the most carefully-kept gardens have surprises in them, courtesy of the infinite variety that is life. --- [Tending My Word-Garden](http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2019/tending-my-word-garden.html)
