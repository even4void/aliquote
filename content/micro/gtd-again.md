Another nice article about [GTD by BSAG](https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/juggling-projects-with-org-mode/). I enjoy reading her blog posts, and I
really love her website design. Funny thing: I was just reading some [old posts](https://bzg.fr/org-gtd.html/)
written by Bastien Guerry on Org mode.
