How many of you are still using or even knowing the [APL language](https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/APL.htm)? I remember that Jan de Leeuw played a bit with R to resurrect it at the REPL several years ago, and that Nick Cox used to use J in addition to Stata. Never used any of those two languages, but the APL book contains a lot of useful information on designing PL.
