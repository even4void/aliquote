I've spent a few more or less pleasant days, long ones in any case, reconfiguring my old 12-inch macbook. Guess what about my [Dell laptop](/post/bye-bye-apple/) and my fresh configuration of [Ubuntu 24.04 LTS](/post/ubuntu-24.04/): the power supply blew up and the SSD along with it. Now everything seems workable (at the very best, for a 6-year old OS). More to come in a blog post later.
