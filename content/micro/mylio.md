I don't have very strong requests from a photo manager other than allowing me to
browse them, and maybe tag or annotate them from time to time. Hence Apple
Photos meets my expectations. However, I understand that others may have more
refined requirements and many apps are available on the market. [Jack Baty](https://www.baty.net)
probably tested them all. In a [recent post](https://www.baty.blog/2019/mylio-as-a-photo-organizer), he suggested [Mylio](https://mylio.com) which looks like
a nice way to manage digital content without any cloud backend. I may try it at
some point.
