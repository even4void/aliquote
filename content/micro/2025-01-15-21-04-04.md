Related to the previous micro-post, see [Proper Python Project Structure 2024](https://matt.sh/python-project-structure-2024) by the same author, which argues against the use of requirements.txt in favor of Poetry. I used Poetry for a work project but I'm now betting on [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). See also [Uv has a killer feature you should know about](https://valatka.dev/2025/01/12/on-killer-uv-feature.html). `#python`
