Yet another TUI app that I recently added to my toolbet, with the hope that it will improve over time: [tdf](https://github.com/itsjunetime/tdf). I heavily rely on Zathura for things related to PDF (espacially for bidirectional sync when using Texlab), altough I came to appreciate Evince with time (it can open DVI and PS file, by the way). With async rendering and hot reloading, I can imagine that tdf could be a great add-on for previewing $\TeX$ compilation results.
