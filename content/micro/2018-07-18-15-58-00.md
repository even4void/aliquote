I finally got rid of the lovely [doom themes](https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes) (one and nord) and got used to spacemacs light theme. As Nikita Prokopov once said (see his [alabaster](https://github.com/tonsky/vscode-theme-alabaster) theme), comments are important: "Most themes try to dim comments by using low-contrast greys. I think if code was complex enough that it deserved an explanation then itâ€™s that explanation we should see and read first. It would be a crime to hide it." They are pretty nicely highlighted in the light theme. Also the font lock for Org code blocks is so great that I use it for Markdown mode as well. `#emacs`
