Interesting links and ideas on exact real arithmetic.

> The problem is made rather difficult by the fact that you can’t compute real numbers strictly, you have to in some sense compute better and better finite approximations. One way of doing this is to compute a stream of arbitrarily good approximations. If someone needs a better approximation than you’ve already given, they pop the next one off. --- [Uniform Continuity is Kind of Like a Lens](http://www.philipzucker.com/uniform-continuity-is-kind-of-like-a-lens/)
