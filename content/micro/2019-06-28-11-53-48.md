Licensing matters surely. However, I feel like it's quite a [good approach](https://common-lisp.net/project/ecl/) to allow using a given software for free but to ask to give it back.

> The meaning of our current license is, in short, the following: you can use ECL for any purpose in any setting (including commercial applications), but if you commit changes to ECL itself you are obliged to share these changes (and only them).
