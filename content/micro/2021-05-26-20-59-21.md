I updated my Zsh config today, just to make terminal tabs (in [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)) show the current running process, instead of the default `$SHELL`. Looks much nicer!

TL;DR Add this to your `.zshrc` or wherever you put custom settings:

```shell
preexec() {
    # See, e.g., https://www.davidpashley.com/articles/xterm-titles-with-bash/
    print -Pn "\e]0;$1\a"
    # or, equivalently,
    # printf "\x1b]0;%s\x07" "$1";
}

precmd() {
    # Clean up terminal title (in case Neovim doesn't restore it to its initial state)
    # printf "\033]0;\a"
    # or print relevant stuff
    # (%~ current working directory; %1~ directory name only)
    print -Pn "\e]0;%1~\a"
}
```
