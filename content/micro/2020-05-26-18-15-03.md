> I personally use “principled” to refer to choices informed by sincere and careful deliberation, in contrast to choices informed by unquestioned defaults that have ossified into convention. A principled workflow considers whether or not modeling assumptions are appropriate and sufficient for answering relevant questions in your particular applied context. Because everyone asks different questions in different contexts, such a workflow cannot be reduced to a deterministic algorithm. All we can do is assemble a coherent set of techniques to help us evaluate our own assumptions and guide our unique path through model space. --- [Towards A Principled Bayesian Workflow](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/principled_bayesian_workflow.html)
