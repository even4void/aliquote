> I’ve seen a number of editors grow popular and then wane. At various times I’ve seen Emacs, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, Atom, SlickEdit, gedit, Notepad++, Sublime, NetBeans, Visual Studio, Xcode, IDLE, PyCharm, Android Studio, and more. Some of those aren’t around any more. I’m not worried about Vim getting eaten by a big tech company, or enshittified to feed advertising or AI ambitions. --- [Choosing Vim over VSCode](https://alexsci.com/blog/vim-over-vscode/)
