> The worst possible way to learn Rust is by vaguely looking at it, or trying some small stuff, in short scattered sessions at night after your demanding work. Sure you did learn a few languages like this before, so you may be confident in your abilities. But at some point in Rust, and it may come soon, you'll encounter a higher step and if you don't fight it with concentration and dedication, you risk not overcome it. --- [How not to learn Rust](https://dystroy.org/blog/how-not-to-learn-rust/)
