[Functional Programming in Data Science Projects](https://towardsdatascience.com/functional-programing-in-data-science-projects-c909c11138bb): Interesting thoughts about FP for statistical computing. Another take was once available on Brian Lee Yung Rowe's weblog, soon to be published as _Modeling Data With Functional Programming In R_. Thomas Mailund also wrote some words about that approach (see _Functional Data Structures in R_). And of course, Mathematica with its native support for multiple programming paradigms would be a good candidate too. `#statistics`
