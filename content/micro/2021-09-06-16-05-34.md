As a consequence of switching to i3wm, my RAM usage dropped down to 550 Mo (instead of 950 Mo) when idle with only one terminal (Kitty). However, since I'm using i3+tmux+kitty+vim keybindings have become a thing, really: Shift+Ctrl for Kitty, C-b (and alt for navigating windows) for tmux, Win key for i3!
