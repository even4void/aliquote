I successfully installed Forge and Controllable for the Minecraft (Java Edition) running on my laptop. Now I can use a PS5 controller to play instead of keyboard shortcuts. Okay, it must be 5 years since I last played, but I'm glad to find a game environment close to the PS4. Sadly, I can't play my old PS4 maps on the Java edition, which means I need to create a new one.
