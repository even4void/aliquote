I did install from scratch almost any app/program on my Mac [15 years ago](https://aliquote.org/post/back-in-mac/). At that time, Mac systems were transitioning from 32 to 64 bits, and it was kind of a mess for some programs. Then I got bored and I choose to rely on Homebrew. Then Homebrew got sort of broken on my Macbook, and I was back at the magic incantation `configure && make && make install`.
