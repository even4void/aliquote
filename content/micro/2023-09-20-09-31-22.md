Trying out [texlab](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab) since yesterday. So far it has been working smoothly alongside vimtex and null-ls (to format bibtex files). Last year I played with [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/index.html), which looks great, especially if you don't want to manage a full installation of the $\TeX$ system. [Both](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab/wiki/Tectonic) seem to play well together. `#vim` `#tex`
