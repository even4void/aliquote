After 4 years I think [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua) remains one of my favorite Neovim plugin. That being said, it is also one of the most astonishing GitHub project where the author is so active that all issues are resolved in due time while he is also providing useful tips all time. Last find is how live grep could potentially handle [current word](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua/issues/1262) (`C-r C-w` doesn't work when using Fzf terminal). `#vim`
