And so we are done with [Black List](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=black+list&t=osx&ia=news), Season 4, as of yesterday evening. We need to take a break, my son and I, and we decided to watch Season 10 of [The Walking Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_%28TV_series%29). It's a perfect fit, isn't it?
