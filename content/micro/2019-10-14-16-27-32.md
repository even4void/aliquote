After upgrading Ubuntu and R on the server at work, I'm now looking for an optimal Mac->Linux iTerm+Tmux+ssh thing. I'm close. In the meantime, I found this: [My remote shell session setup](https://blog.filippo.io/my-remote-shell-session-setup/), but I believe `mosh` is not the [recommended way](https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/wikis/tmux-Integration-Best-Practices) anymore. And I know I definitely need to re-read [this](https://github.com/samoshkin/tmux-config) again.
