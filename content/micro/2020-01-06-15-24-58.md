Yet another intro to the tidyverse, FWIW: [Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the tidyverse](https://moderndive.com/index.html). I don't really understand why there need to be a `rep_sample_n()` function in chapter 7 (which is just imported from the `infer` package by `moderndive`, see the signature of the function) which does nothing more than what could possibly be done easily with `base::sample`. This drives me crazy sometimes. `#rstats`
