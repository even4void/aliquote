While I usually run Slime for little Lisp hacking, I noticed that [serious people](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51284086)
are looking at [SLY](https://github.com/joaotavora/sly), the Sylvester the Cat's Common Lisp IDE for Emacs. It looks
like there is even a [Spacemacs layer](https://github.com/mfiano/common-lisp-sly). `#emacs` `#lisp`
