I spent some time figuring out why my Zsh startup time became so slow over time. Initially I thought about `compinit`, and I added this fix mentioned everywhere on the internet (read `zcompdump` once per day):

```shell
# autoload -U compinit && compinit
autoload -Uz compinit
if [ $(date +'%j') != $(stat -f '%Sm' -t '%j' ~/.config/zsh/.zcompdump) ]; then
  compinit
else
  compinit -C
fi
```

This helped, but the real culprint was NVM which considerably slows down Zsh startup with its loading script `nvm.sh`. I use the [following trick](https://superuser.com/a/1611283). In retrospect, `compinit` isn't accounting for that much time when checked agaisnt `zprof`, but Zsh now starts like a breeze again:

```shell
~/.config/zsh
Â» time zsh -i -c exit

Saving session...completed.
zsh -i -c exit  0,03s user 0,03s system 90% cpu 0,073 total
```
