[Why I (as of June 22 2019) think Haskell is the best general purpose language](http://www.philipzucker.com/why-i-as-of-june-22-2019-think-haskell-is-the-best-general-purpose-language-as-of-june-22-2019/). For me, Haskell remains hard, even if switching to [stack](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2018/02/10/an-opinionated-guide-to-haskell-in-2018/) saved me form all those Go I used once in a while. `#haskell`
