[SSH to a machine behind firewall](https://lalinsky.com/2009/10/28/ssh-to-a-machine-behind-firewall.html). On a related note, `LocalCommand` and `RemoteCommand` are also handy in some cases, e.g., `LocalCommand osascript -e "tell application \"Terminal\" to set current settings of window 1 to settings set \"ssh\""` to change Apple Terminal theme when ssh'ing on a remomte machine, or `RemoteCommand tmux new -A -s remote -n main` to start Tmux right when connecting to a remote server.
