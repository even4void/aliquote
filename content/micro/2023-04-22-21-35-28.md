[Blade Runner 2049](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner_2049): +1. Although, (1) it is fair too long (163'), and (2) the end (I mean, the last hour really) leaves much to be desired. Now, I started watching [The Last Kingdom](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Kingdom_(TV_series)>), after [Vikings](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings_(TV_series)>) and [Vikings Valhala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings:_Valhalla). I guess I will still prefer Vikings over the two other ones. `#self`
