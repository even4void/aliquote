I almost done redesigning the site using a simpler theme, hopefully as responsive as the previsous one ([Even](https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even)). This time, I started with [Ezhil](https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil) and I've modified it extensively to meet my needs. It only remains to manage old posts with TOML header (to be converted to YAML header) and fix `pre` block.
