Didn't know there was such a thing: [MacJournal](https://welcometosherwood.wordpress.com/2019/02/18/macjournal-still-the-best-notebook-for-macos/) (via [Jack Baty](https://www.baty.blog/2019/whydya-do-it-steve)). Whether you are
interested in this app or not, the author provides a nice discussion of the pros
and cons of keeping a diary vs. a journal, and on the importance of meta data.
