I just realized today that VS Code was using Jedi as the default backend for its LSP server. It's still possible to use the MS Python server: same as under Emacs, once you select that option, all MS stuff get downloaded and VS Code gets pretty unusable for quite a few moments when you open a Python project. That was not [Emacs fault](/micro/2020-06-22-21-00-20/), right? So I'm now back to Emacs full day. What a life! `#emacs`
