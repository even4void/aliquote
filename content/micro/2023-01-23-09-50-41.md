[Elements of Data Science](https://allendowney.github.io/ElementsOfDataScience/) is "an introduction to data science for people with no programming experience. My goal is to present a small, powerful subset of Python that allows you to do real work in data science as quickly as possible." Great work by Allen Downey as always.
