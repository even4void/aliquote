TIL Spacemacs now supports Doom [modeline](https://seagle0128.github.io/doom-modeline/) (or check [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs)); just add `dotspacemacs-mode-line-theme 'doom` to your `dotspacemacs/layers`. Better to use it with doom-themes, though. Next, [org-journal](https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal) is available in a [dedicated layer](https://github.com/borgnix/spacemacs-journal) on Spacemacs. Great! But wait, it is already [supported by the org-layer](http://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+emacs/org/README.html#org-journal-support). How come I didn't know that! RTFM.  `#emacs`
