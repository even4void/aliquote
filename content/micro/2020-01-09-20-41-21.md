A few days ago, I watched [Anna](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7456310/) (in two stages since I'm so exhausted these days because of the strike!). I found it so bad that I thought I would be better watching [Nikita](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100263/) again. Much better indeed, and this confirmed my original idea that Anna is just a pale copy. Until I realized they were produced by the same guy...
