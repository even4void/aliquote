> I have two high-quality CL implementations on my machine and one Scheme-derived system, also of very high quality, which created this blog: I have long ago stopped counting the number of good-quality free implementations. (...) Performance is a solved problem: yes, highly-optimised code is, perhaps, slower than optimised C or Fortran but since almost all performance problems are design problems no-one older than about 19 cares any more. (...) The library problem has been solved by Quicklisp and a large number of good-quality standard libraries. I am still using code I wrote over twenty-five years ago with essentially no modification: meanwhile the Python code I wrote ten years ago is long rendered obsolete by gratuitous changes in the language (the Perl code I wrote at the same time is doing fine, however). --- [Rumours of my death](https://www.tfeb.org/fragments/2015/02/01/rumours-of-my-death/)
