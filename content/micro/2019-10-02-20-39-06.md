I believe this the canonical way to filter in a Pandas data frame, say `d`, rows that contain or better, match exactly, the word "gene":

```python
d[d["type"].str.match("gene", na=False)]
```
<small>(The `na=False` option is just because there are some NaN values.)</small>

Now I understand why I prefer functional languages, and more specifically why I prefer to write and chain together simple functions in Python rather than implementing complex class with shadowed methods, setters and getters. `#python`
