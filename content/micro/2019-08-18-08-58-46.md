[tmux in practice: iTerm2 and tmux](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/tmux-in-practice-iterm2-and-tmux-integration-7fb0991c6c01/). I'm quite happy with iTerm only, since I don't need to share my session across different computer for the moment. But if this were the case, sure I would come back to this nice post and the associated [Github repo](https://github.com/samoshkin/tmux-config#iterm2-and-tmux-integration).
