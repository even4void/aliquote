Not sure what data-oriented programming is but I bookmarked two posts the other day and I thought I could share them:

- [Data-oriented Programming in Python](https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/data_oriented_python/)
- [An introduction to Data Oriented Design with Rust](https://jamesmcm.github.io/blog/2020/07/25/intro-dod/)
