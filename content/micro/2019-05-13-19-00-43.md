I have no regret now that I took some time to reread this chapter on [Mastering Eshell](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/complete-guide-mastering-eshell). A few days back, I decided to switch back to [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) and to use a very minimal configuration, which means no fancy zsh or bash terms, just plain Eshell. `#emacs`
