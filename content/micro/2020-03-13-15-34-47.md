> Cyberpunk is both a genre and a culture. As a genre, cyberpunk was born out of early 20th century noir and fuelled through the drugs, sex and tech of 60s and 70s counterculture movements. As a culture, Cyberpunk represents a tech-savvy identity associated with anti-authoritarianism and anti-consumerism. --- [Tales From The Dork Web #4](https://thedorkweb.substack.com/p/tales-from-the-dork-web-4)
