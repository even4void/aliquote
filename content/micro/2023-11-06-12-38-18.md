[Solving the puzzle of the address-of operator](https://okmij.org/ftp/meta-programming/mutable-var.html#addr-of). `#clang`

Other subtleties of the C language: There are [two ways](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38145319) to index an array `a`, either `a[i]` or `i[a]`, as illustrated below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  int i = 2;

  printf("i[arr]: %d\n", i[arr]);
  printf("arr[i]: %d\n", arr[i]);
}
```
