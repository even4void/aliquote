> Using a 12-bit colour depth limits the available colours, so slight changes to hue, chroma, and luminance must be made, but these are small enough not to be noticeable. The resulting palette has evenly-spaced hues, only small variations in chroma, and smoothly increasing and decreasing luminance. --- [The 12-bit rainbow palette](https://iamkate.com/data/12-bit-rainbow/)
