A few days ago, I noticed someone citing [A Computational Approach to Statistical
Learning](http://www.comp-approach.com) on Twitter. I no longer buy statistical books so I can't tell if it is
worth a read, but I note that the author of the R package [bigmemory](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bigmemory/index.html) is one of
the co-authors.
