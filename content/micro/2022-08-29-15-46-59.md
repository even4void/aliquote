Here's a rather long list of [RSS feeds](/pub/urls~) accumulated over the years. It has been purged on several occasions, depending on my mood and succesive jobs (e.g., `rstats` and `stats` stuff has been severely impacted in the past 6 years). It targets Newsboat, so all you have to do is put this file in your `$HOME/.config/newsboat` directory. Tags are not always very accurate, as the original posters may have changed their posts over time.
