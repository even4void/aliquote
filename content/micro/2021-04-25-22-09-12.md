> If you want a single piece of advice to reduce your bug count, itâ€™s this: Re-read your code frequently. After writing a few lines of code (3 to 6 lines, a short block within a function), re-read them. That habit will save you more time than any other simple change you can make. --- [Don't write bugs](https://www.teamten.com/lawrence/programming/dont-write-bugs.html)
