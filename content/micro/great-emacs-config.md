Look, I read two of the latest newletters by Sacha Chua and I already learned
about two new Org features: [org-reverse-datetree](https://github.com/akirak/org-reverse-datetree/blob/master/README.org) and [org-bib-template](https://github.com/tsdye/org-bib-template). Moreover,
I didn't know that there were such thing as meta repository for [ESS users](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/esscss/blob/master/README.md). `#emacs`
