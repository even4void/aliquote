[Python for Epidemiologists](https://github.com/pzivich/Python-for-Epidemiologists), feat. [zEpid](https://github.com/pzivich/zEpid) which I just discover right now. `#python`

> A few highlights: basic epidemiology calculations, easily create functional form
> assessment plots, easily create effect measure plots, generate and conduct
> diagnostic tests. Implemented estimators include; inverse probability of
> treatment weights, inverse probability of censoring weights, inverse
> probabilitiy of missing weights, augmented inverse probability weights,
> time-fixed g-formula, Monte Carlo g-formula, Iterative conditional g-formula,
> and targeted maximum likelihood (TMLE).

Note that `lifelines` requires Matplotlib 2.2.3 but the latest release, as
upgraded when installing `zepid`, is 3.0.2. How nice!
