Trying out [Tactile](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4548/tactile/) as an additional Window Manager for Gnome shell. Looks great. No auto-tiling (you have to manually assign new windows to predefined tiles on a grid, but this is flexible. However, it works like a charm right (and out of the box), unlike Forge or gTile. Gnome default tiling behavior works alongside, which is great. Together with Simple terminal or Gnome terminal (preferred), this makes for a great tiling WM. Also, none of the shell extensions (Unite, undecorate, ...) I tried were able to properly remove window decorations, and it seems like there always are edge cases anyway.
