Well, nobody seems to care about [xlispstat support](https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS/issues/154) anymore. Just got a weird
error when trying to load some old code from UCLA, notwithstanding the fact that
Spacemacs/ESS actually autoload Julia mode. `#emacs`

```text
File mode specification error: ... ess-20190126.1259/ess-site.elc
failed to define function XLS-mode)
```
