I've been following Darren Wilkinson's work for a long time now, and even if I'm not really interested in Scala I keep checking his blog and GitHub from time to time. He just released a course on functional programming for scientific computing, available at GH. Go check his blog to learn more: [An introduction to functional programming for scalable statistical computing and machine learning](https://darrenjw.wordpress.com/2023/02/04/an-introduction-to-functional-programming-for-scalable-statistical-computing-and-machine-learning/).
