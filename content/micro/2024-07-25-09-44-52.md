From time to time, I make a few infidelities with cmus and use [gapless](https://github.com/neithern/g4music) (formerly g4music). It's a great piece of software which I initially compiled from scratch until I decided to rely on the Flathub version. I once generate `m3u` playlists for relevant folders in my global library and they come up nicely in the playlist view. See my review [here](/posts/g4music).
