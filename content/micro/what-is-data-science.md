What is Data Science after all? I never liked this term, and I consider myself
as a statistician, or better a data craftsman, because I mostly spend my time
dealing with data after all. Stephanie C. Hicks & Roger D. Peng wrote a nice
article, [Elements and Principles of Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07639v1), which I believe provides
quite an honest account of DS-related stuff:

> Data science is the science and design of (1) actively creating a question to
> inves- tigate a hypothesis with data, (2) connecting that question with the
> collection of appro- priate data and the application of appropriate methods,
> algorithms, computational tools or languages in a data analysis, and (3)
> communicating and making decisions based on new or already established knowledge
> derived from the data and data analysis.
