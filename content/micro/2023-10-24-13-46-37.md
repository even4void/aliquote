[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/) is really great: even simple `assert` statements get processed, no need to write complex fixtures or test suite. This means you can write your scripts as usual and just `import pytest`. To avoid contaminating your current directory with `__pycache__` and `.pytest_cache` directories, set the exported variable `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` and call pytest with `-p no:cacheprovider`. You can set a simple compiler and errorformat for (Neo)vim by following this [blog post](https://phelipetls.github.io/posts/vim-errorformat-for-pytest/). Personally, I use `makeprg=pytest\ --tb=short\ -vv\ --no-header\ -p\ no:cacheprovider\ $*` instead. `#python` `#vim`
