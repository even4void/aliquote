If you want to disable syntax highlighting in Neovim 0.11+, you'll need to disable lsp-semantic_tokens (`lua vim.lsp-semantic_tokens.Stop(0, 1)`), in addition to treesitter (`TSBufDisable highlight`) and stock syntax (`syntax off`). Better off using the `quiet` colorscheme as I do for quite a few months now. `#vim`
