I don't use Cabal that often, and I manage almost everything with Stack. I accidently installed a package (bhoogle) that adds nothing to Hoogle, but there's no `cabal delete` or `cabal uninstall`, you know. So I simply nuked the whole `$HOME/.cabal` directory that GHCup installed for me with an older version of Cabal. And now I can't get it back. Instead, Cabal now follows the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7386), which means compiled stuff will end up in `$HOME/.local/state`. Let's go for another env variable (`CABAL_DIR`) then. `#haskell`
