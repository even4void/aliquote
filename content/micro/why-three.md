Why the 3? Earlier in the morning I was reading one of the latest posts published by
John D. Cook about [dose finding studies](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/02/12/dose-escalation/). I am well aware of the [3+3 design](/post/cross-over-trials).
Incidentally, I attended a meeting yesterday where a PhD student was presenting
his work in microbiology, and they used triplicates. It is interesting that the
same 3 seems like a magic number here, but it is not the same. Maybe I should
drop a note in a few days.
