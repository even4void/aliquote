[Mercurial's Journey to and Reflections on Python 3](https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2020/01/13/mercurial's-journey-to-and-reflections-on-python-3/). String literals are so fucking awesom in Python.

> In Python 2, a '' string literal is a sequence of bytes. In Python 3, a '' string literal is a sequence of Unicode code points. These are fundamentally different types. And in Mercurial's code base, most of our string types are binary by design: use of a Unicode based str for representing data is flat out wrong for our use case.
