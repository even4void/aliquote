[Machine learning in Clojure with XGBoost](https://www.rdisorder.eu/2018/12/03/machine-learning-clojure-xgboost/). Note that there are bindings for the
[awesome xgboost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/tree/master/demo) in various other languages (Python, Julia, R), not just the JVM.
`#clojure`

> Python didn't become the leader in the field because it's inherently better or
> more performant, but because of scikit-learn, pandas and so on. While as
> Clojurists we don't really need pandas (dataframes) or similar stuff (everything
> is just a map, or if you care more about memory and performance a record) we
> don't have something like scikit-learn that makes really easy to train many kind
> of machine learning models and somewhat easier to deploy them.
