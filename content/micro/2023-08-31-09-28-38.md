> Nushell isn't exactly a shell, at least not in the traditional Unix sense of the word. Nushell is trying to answer the question: "what if we asked more of our shells?" --- [The case for Nushell](https://www.jntrnr.com/case-for-nushell/)

With recent support for [data frames](https://www.nushell.sh/book/dataframes.html), it becomes an interesting challenger for tiny on-the-fly data wrangling scripts. Beware that it relies on [polars-arrow](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) which (most of the time) require a recent stable Rust. Also, if you encounter an E0034 ("multiple applicable items in scope") when compiling polars-related dependencies, try adding [`--locked`](https://stackoverflow.com/q/76989793) to `cargo install`. When you're done, enjoy the power of data frames right into your shell!

With my [last timing](/micro/2023-08-28-12-46-04/) for processing a 30 Mb CSV file, loading the file in Nu shell is a breeze:

```shell
~/tmp> timeit {dfr open ./nycflights.csv}
70ms 682µs 766ns
~/tmp> timeit {open ./nycflights.csv}
1sec 194ms 477µs 961ns
```

<small>First instruction uses `dfr open` while the second instruction relies on builtin `open` command.</small>
