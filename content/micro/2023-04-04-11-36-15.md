> The immediate future is easy to predict, because the same things that has been happening for years will continue to happen: Some of the exciting recent advances will be cancelled out by new compiler regressions due to fancy new compiler features. We users will create still deeper code stacks that racks up latency, even more so with Julia 1.9 now that latency has improved and we can "afford" to do so. --- [Julia's latency: Past, present and future](https://viralinstruction.com/posts/latency/index.html#impact_of_efforts_so_far)
