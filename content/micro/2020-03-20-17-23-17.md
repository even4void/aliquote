TIL about [simul](https://www.simuldocs.com/), for those of you who need to collaborate using Word.

> I've tried LaTex, because that's what all the cool science kids are doing, but I don't think the hassle is worth it. Show me a LaTex evangelist and I'll show you someone who doesn't collaborate with Word users. There's too much software hipster-ism out there. I think you should use the software that best gets the job done for you. --- Daniel Quintena on [Uses This](https://usesthis.com/interviews/daniel.quintana/)
