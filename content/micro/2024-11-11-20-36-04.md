I'm pretty happy with new management system for my audio file. Thanks to [Beets](https://beets.io) I now have access to the whole power of command line utilities. Here's a brief overview of the top genres in my library:

```shell
» beet summarize | head -n 12
genre                  | count
---------------------- | -----
Rock                   | 3045
Post-Punk              | 2754
Jazz                   | 2509
Alternative            | 1212
Electronic             | 948
Indie Rock             | 838
Pop                    | 817
Classic Rock           | 679
Alternative Rock       | 497
Indie Pop              | 424
```

How many total tracks having a genre tag, excluding tracks from playlists which contain, following poor design choice, duplicate records?

```shell
» beet summarize ^context:playlist | head -n 12 | cut -f2 -d\| | tail -n +3 | paste -sd+ | bc
10603
```

And so on... Wanna looks at the tlistening stats for the current song?

```shell
» beet ls -f '$artist ($album): $title ($length) [$genre, $play_count, $last_played]' $(mpc current | sed s/-//)
Diana Krall (The Girl in the Other Room): Narrow Daylight (3:31) [Contemporary Jazz, 12, 2024-11-11 20:38:09]
```
