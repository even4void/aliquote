I'm quite happy actually with how Spacemacs handles LSP for various modes I make
regularly use of (Python, JS, C), thanks to the wonderful [lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode). Today, I
discovered that there's another "universal" package, [eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot), for dealing with all
available servers. (via [@hillelogram](https://twitter.com/hillelogram/status/1111422101078958080)) `#emacs`
