I already said in one of my recent posts on the main blog that I rarely use Stata these days. Yet I continue reading the Stata blog, and I was happy to see Chuck Huber taking the lead on the most recent posts. At the time of this writing, this is all about [Python integration](https://blog.stata.com/2020/09/14/stata-python-integration-part-5-three-dimensional-surface-plots-of-marginal-predictions/), which I find nice after all. I have a somewhat outdated version of Stata since I'm no longer a Stata trainer for public and private companies, but I remain interested in how Stata is evolving. `#stata`
