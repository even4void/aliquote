I recently came across some Racket code on [Reddit][] that implements Fenwick trees, aka binary indexed trees (BIT). Fenwick's article, which is not the original paper on that particular data structure, [A New Data Structure for Cumulative Frequency Tables][] (PDF) explains all the details, but there's also a [nice tutorial][], as well as some [applications][] for competitive programming.
