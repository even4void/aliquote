[Measured: Typing latency of Zutty (compared to others)](https://tomscii.sig7.se/2021/01/Typing-latency-of-Zutty): Sadly no stats for [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot). Given the existing [benchmarks](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/wiki/Performance), I would expect it to be in lowest range of typing latency as well but this would need some perf tests. `#unix`
