I upgraded to Emacs 27 recently, and I found two little annoying things: there's now a warning about the `cl` package that has been deprecrated for a long time now (everything is okay in Doom core modules, this is just the packages `flyspell-lazy` and `persp-mode` which happen to trigger the warning with their `(require 'cl)`), and Ivy posframe [gets sometimes stuck](https://github.com/tumashu/ivy-posframe/issues/92). `#emacs`
