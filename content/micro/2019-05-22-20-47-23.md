While I'm no big fan of convutional or bayesian or even simple NNs, Deep Learning and the like, those techniques certainly outperform standard techniques when it comes to image processing. See, e.g., [Few-Shot Adversarial Learning of Realistic Neural Talking Head Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08233) for a recent shot. `#arxiv`
