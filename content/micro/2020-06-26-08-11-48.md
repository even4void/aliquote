> I try to make sure I largely spend the time on things I enjoy, but it gets more complicated once you start selling work. Processing and shipping orders takes quite a bit of time. And it isn't exactly my favorite activity. Obviously I enjoy the fact that people are willing to buy my work. But I can't say I enjoy handling the paperwork, and dealing with packaging and shipping. --- [Making money](https://inconvergent.net/2020/making-money/)
