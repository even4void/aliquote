[Reference management with Org mode](https://llazarek.com/2020/04/reference-management-with-org-mode.html).<br>
My workflow is apparently simpler, thanks to `ivy-bibtex`, but overall I agree that Org is well suited for such kind of tasks. I only use Markdown for light stuff (e.g., Github READMEs) and blogging, but I guess I will switch to using Org mode exclusively soon or later. `#emacs`
