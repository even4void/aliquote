Ok, so I just tried out [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/). While this looks like a great WM, unfortunately it does not really support i3 [stacking and tabbing](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_changing_the_container_layout) features --- at least [for the moment](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/203) (see also this more [recent update](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/337)), which (I believe) would be the most interesting options for small Retina displays. Update: I reinstalled the HEAD version and tried the "stack" layout, which looks like a simple fullscreen display, not really stacking Ã  la i3wm.
