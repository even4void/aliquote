How about generating figure name using MD5 hash? I've long been wondering how to
store unique file names for all documents that I happen to write from day to
day. The last few years, I decided to prefix all such file names using either
`fig-` or `img-` depending on the context (i.e., whether it has been generated by a
computer program or in the case it's just an illustration grabed on the
internet), followed by a short but meaningful description, e.g.
`img-emacs-screenshot.png`. When it is a series of figures, I usually append an
index ("a", "b", ...; or zero-padded numbers). Still I have lot of duplicates
file names on my HD. One way to circumvent this issue is to generate random
hash, or I believe so since we all have the `md5` utility on Un\*x systems. Here we
go:

```shell
current master ✗ 74db262 22h25m ✖ △ ◒  md5 -s "emacs-screenshot"
MD5 ("emacs-screenshot") = 65c9ef7d939db96dd290adcf9597d65b
```
