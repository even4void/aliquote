How nice! Frank Harrell is about to release [blrm](http://hbiostat.org/R/rms/blrm.html), an extension of the [rms](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rms/index.html) package for Bayesian binary and ordinal proportional odds logistic regression. Together with [brms](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/index.html), the bayesian toolbox has grown fast on CRAN the last few years.
