I'm using `ox-pandoc` as my main engine to export Org documents to HTML or PDF. This is mostly because I know Pandoc better than the basic (Lua)Latex + Minted/`lstlistings` that I haven't used in years. Funny enough, the `#+ATTR_LATEX` is not recognized by Pandoc, but part of `#+ATTR_HTML` settings (e.g., `:width 75%` to resize image) are honored during the export. However, neither of the HTML or PDF output include the `#+CAPTION:` legend! `#emacs` `#org`
