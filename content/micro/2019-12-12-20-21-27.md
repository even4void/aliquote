> Writing Isn’t Magic; It’s Hard Work<br>
> I used to struggle to get my thoughts onto the page because the first time I put them down, they were complete crap. The second time I put them down, they were also crap. And the third time. And the fourth time. And the fifth time. But each time, what I was writing got a little bit better, and eventually I realized that by approximately the fiftieth time I revised something, I’d have something really good; therefore, if I wanted to write something worth reading, all I had to do was put in the time and effort to revise it enough times. --- [My Year In Review: 2019](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2019/12/10/my-year-in-review-2019)

So nothing unusual about what I write sometimes looks like shit: I never reread more than one and a half times.
