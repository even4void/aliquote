If you are looking for a lightweight and more user privacy-friendly alternative
to Disqus, maybe you should take a look at [Commento](https://commento.io) (via [BSAG](https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/trying-out-commento/)). I'm not sure
this service will last forever and I am not expecting so much comments on this
random site so I'll skip my turn but having an alternative to Disqus is still
interesting.
