I just came across this new book: [Foundations of Data Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/book.pdf) (PDF, 479 pp.). It
looks great and furthermore this is one of those rare books which provides an
original approach to data science and machine learning from rigorous
(mathematical) arguments. Other resources are provided in the following [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/yminsky/status/1064713458774622209).
