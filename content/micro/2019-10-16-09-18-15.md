[Moving to zsh](https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh/). I've been diving with Zsh long before it became the *de facto* shell on macOS, and I just moved again, this time for [Fish](/post/fish-shell). However, there's always something nice to learn from Scripting OS X, so I'll keep this in my bookmarks, especially since I still use zsh occasionally (because of Emacs multi-term which doesn't seem to like Fish very much). Thorsten Ball has a nice [init file](https://github.com/mrnugget/dotfiles), btw.
