Almost two months with new MacBook and I'm back to my old habits using Tmux and Neomutt all day. Apple Mail is fine but I manage my e-mails 3 times faster with neomutt. Likewise, Apple Terminal has been enhanced over the years but nothing beats Tmux when it comes to manage long-running sessions, multiple panes, and paste buffers. That being said I'm happy everything is kept in sync and I can switch to whichever software to suit my mood. `#apple`
