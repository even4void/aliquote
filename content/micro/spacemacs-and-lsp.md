The `lsp` backend for the Python layer in Spacemacs has so much improved over
time, and it is much more featured than the default `anaconda` one. Pending minor
issues with [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which complains about missing imports (this can be resolved
using a config file, as described [here](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config%5Ffile.html)), everything works perfectly. Things are
going too fast for me with the develop branch of Spacemacs. `#emacs`
