I still read _Mastering Emacs_ from time to time. Recently, I was just checking
an article on [regular expression](https://masteringemacs.org/article/re-builder-interactive-regexp-builder). I have been using Emacs for about 15 years and
I am afraid that now I would be far more comfortable with most key chords after
two or three years of [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org). This is not that I really like modal editing--I
don't like it at all in fact--but the consistent key bindings conveyed via
[which-key](https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key) and the configuration layers for most packages make it a really
pleasant tool to use on a daily basis. I've come to have only Emacs on my
desktop. No more [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) or [Marked2](http://marked2app.com) or even Desktop icons. `#emacs`
