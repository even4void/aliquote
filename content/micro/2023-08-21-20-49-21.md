[GNU Parallel, where have you been all my life?](https://alexplescan.com/posts/2023/08/20/gnu-parallel/): Yet another nice example of why `parallel` is such a great program. I learned to use it a while ago, after having read Jearoen Janssens' wonderful book, _Data Science at the Command Line_, in its first edition. BTW, the 2nd edition is available [online](https://jeroenjanssens.com/dsatcl/) for free.
