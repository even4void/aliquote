I'm currently processing all my blog posts --- cleaning things here and there. And so I was thinking that a lot of code snippets I post on this blog could be rendered as Gist, as Hugo offers a nice shortcode for that specific purpose. So here we go:

{{< gist even4void b839d4b99d53a7fd9d6b84681efb7e0f >}}

Compare to the [original version](/post/polya-meets-euler/).
