Just replaced ranger with [fff](https://github.com/dylanaraps/fff). Looks great and lightweight, and ultra-fast. I had problem with displaying images with ranger now that I am under Wayland. With fff, I can simply open them in feh or eog and browse an entire directory using keyboard shortcuts only.
