I haven't update Doom Emacs during the week, except for env variables because I [switched to Fish](https://aliquote.org/post/fish-shell/) recently. I know there are probably plenty of updates on (M)ELPA, but the Python LSP layer works quite nicely, and the same applies to functional languages I use to use these days. So why uopdating again and again? I probably reached the point where you no longer want to live in a 'beta' world, and just start to be more productive with the tools you have right in your hands. BTW, I uninstalled VS Code yesterday: I still think this is the best multi-OS editor I've seen so far, but too much noise for me, and so few plugins for functional languages that it makes me feel like I could just use TextEdit instead, or maybe Vim. `#emacs`
