> Refinement types give us the ability to define validation rules, or more commonly called predicates, at the type level. This means we get compile-time validation whenever the values are known at compile-time. --- [Parallel typeclass for Haskell](https://gvolpe.github.io/blog/parallel-typeclass-for-haskell/)

Aside from the compilation aspect, I think that `assert` like statements (in Stata or Python) are very close to the above statement in statistical programming.
