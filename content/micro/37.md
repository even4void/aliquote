"The numbers 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, and 999 are all evenly
divisible by 37, leaving no remainder." (via
[@pickover](<https://twitter.com/pickover/status/1057092080449806336>)) Using base
10 notation, a three-digit number, say $aaa$, can be written as $100\cdots a +
10\cdot a + a = a \cdot (100 + 10 + 1) = a \cdot 111$. Clearly, 111 is a divisor
of $aaa$ ($111 = 37\times 3$), but also of 222, 333, ... Hence, all three-digit
numbers that are multiple of 111 will fit the bill.
