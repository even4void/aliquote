Update on Regolith Desktop: Now installed on my own laptop. Back to a dark theme (Nord) for the moment. One of the main advantage of Regolith over, say i3 or i3-gaps, is that all Ubuntu apps and settings remain available, including controllers that have to be defined manually in i3 (e.g., brightness or volume control, screen sharing or capture). The integration of native app (e.g., nautilus or gnome-terminal) is also really nice.
