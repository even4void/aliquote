Update on Regolith Desktop: Now installed on my own laptop for more precise control. Back to a dark theme (Nord) -- long time no see. One of the main advantage of Regolith over, say, i3 or i3-gaps, is that all Ubuntu apps and settings remain available, including controllers that would have to be defined manually otherwise (e.g., brightness or volume control, screen sharing or screen capture). The integration of native apps (e.g., nautilus or gnome-terminal) is also really nicely handled by the WM without excessive RAM usage (< 800 Mo).
