TIL that we can use [references and labels](https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-Examples.html) in Org babel!

> You can also add a ‘-r’ switch which removes the labels from the source code. With the ‘-n’ switch, links to these references are labeled by the line numbers from the code listing. Otherwise links use the labels with no parentheses. Here is an example:

        #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n -r
        (save-excursion                 (ref:sc)
            (goto-char (point-min))      (ref:jump)
        #+END_SRC
        In line [[(sc)]] we remember the current position. [[(jump)][Line (jump)]]
        jumps to point-min.
