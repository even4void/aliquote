For unknown reasons --- but maybe I have noticed it earlier, iTerm seems to be draining my battery a lot. Switching again to [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/index.html#) for some days, to see how it goes. My past impressions were quite good, so hopefully I will have a pretty terminal emulator. Looks very fast so far. `#apple`
