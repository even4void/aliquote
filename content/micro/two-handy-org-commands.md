Two handy org commands: `org-journal-new-scheduled-entry` can be used to schedule
future entries in [org-journal](https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal) (see discussion [here](https://bastibe.de/2018-04-02-scheduling-future-todos-in-org-journal.html)); `org-tree-to-indirect-buffer`
is a good alternative to `org-narrow-to-subtree` sometimes. `#org`
