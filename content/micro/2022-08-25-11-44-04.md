> Beautiful code is likely to be simple -- clear and easy to understand. Beautitful code is likely to be compact -- just enough code to do the job and no more -- but not cryptic, to the point where it cannot be understood. Beautiful code may well be general, solving a broad class of problems in a uniform way. One might even describe it as elegant, showing good taste and refinement. --- [A Regular Expression Matcher](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html)
