Tonight I updated my default colorscheme (`quiet`) in Neovim when I noticed there was a monochrome version. Since we cannot set `t_Co` in Neovim, I create a user colorscheme named `morequiet` using these specs only. I added a few tweaks for diff mode (I like the look'n feel of the `quiet` colors in this case) and TODO-like `@comment.*` identified by Treesitter. So far so good. `#vim`
