True concealing in Vim using multiple characters (thanks to [Brian Albert Monroe](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61368522/420055)). Add this in your Vim config (possibly in `after/syntax/r.vim`):

```vim
call matchadd('Conceal', '|>\&|', 10, -1, {'conceal':'»'})
call matchadd('Conceal', '|\zs>', 10, -1, {'conceal':'='})

syntax match rOperator "%>%" conceal cchar=»

hi! link Conceal Operator
```
<small>Not sure I will really need the magrittr's pipe operator, so I didn't bother using Haskell's monad sequencing operator with value passing.</small>

Result:
