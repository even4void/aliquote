> There exists however one common trait for virtually all of text editors: they are written by and for developers. Consequently, design is generally not the primary concern and the final product does not usually enforce best recommendations in terms of appearance, interface design or even user interaction. The most striking example is certainly the syntax colorization that seems to go against every good de- sign principles in a majority of text editors and the motto guiding design could be summarized by “Let’s add more colors” (using regex). --- [On the design of text editors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06030)
