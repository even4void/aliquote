[Scientists rise up against statistical significance](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9). Together with
[Moving to a World Beyond "p < 0.05"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913), it is probably time to rethink statistical
significance and embrace the world of uncertainty instead. As Stephen Seen [once
said](/post/dicing-with-death/):

> We can predict nothing with certainty but we can predict how uncertain our
> predictions will be, on average that is. Statistics is the science that tells us
> how.
