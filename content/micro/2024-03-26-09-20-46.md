"When the underlying measurements are normally distributed, you can "convert" a range measurement into an estimate for the standard deviation" using the [D2 constant](https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2024/02/21/range-d2.html). As always, Rick Wicklin wrote a very interesting article for those involved in QC or dealing with small samples. See also [On using flexible distributions to fit data](https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2024/02/26/fit-flexible-distribution.html) for another interesting story.
