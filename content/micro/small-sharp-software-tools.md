[Small Sharp Software Tools](https://www.smallsharpsoftwaretools.com). Together with [Vince Buffalo](http://vincebuffalo.org)'s _Bioinformatics Data
Skills_, I believe this combo should provide the very best technical exposition
to practical Unix. You may want to add [Learning Unix for OS X](/post/learning-unix-for-os-x/) if you're
interested in Mac-specific tools. (Disclaimer: I haven't read Hogan's book yet).
