[Mac OS Big Sur logbook (intro)](http://morrick.me/archives/8945). `#apple`

> I donâ€™t believe in upgrading your devices for the sake of upgrading, but I believe that in this day and age one has to be technologically flexible.

At this point in time, I don't think I will buy a new Macbook or even upgrade to Big Sur (I skipped Catalina too), even if I like the revived design of most of Apple apps. I work with a terminal emulator and Safari most of the time, I use Preview for reading PDF files, and Marked to render Markdown files; I barely have any use of the Finder these days. Sort of I could live in another BSD machine without noticing it, except for the browser.
