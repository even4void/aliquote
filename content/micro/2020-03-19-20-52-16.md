From [HN](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51968302):

> Netflix will reduce the video quality on its service in Europe for the next 30 days, to reduce the strain on internet service providers.

I have a hard time believing this could happen --- I'm no Netflix consumer, btw, since all other French provider are actually offering their channel package for free. But I can understand the consequences of everyone connecting to internet all day along.
