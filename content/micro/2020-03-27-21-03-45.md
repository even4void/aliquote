> Log only impure actions. (...) You may still have some code that occasionally executes impure actions, but largely, most of the code is pure. If you know the inputs to all the pure code, you can reproduce that part of the code. This means that you only need to log the non-deterministic parts: the impure actions. Particularly, you need to log the outputs from the impure actions, because these impure output values become the inputs to the next pure block of code. --- [Repeatable execution](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2020/03/23/repeatable-execution/)
