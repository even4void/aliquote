> The biggest misconception about Rust is that it’s "harder" than other languages. But that’s only true if you measure difficulty by how fast you can start writing code. If you measure difficulty by how long it takes to debug, maintain, and make a system reliable, the playing field levels out. --- [Rust is not harder than other languages](https://marma.dev/articles/2025/rust-is-not-harder-than-other-languages)
