> I estimated that I had used my mac for approximately 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, 48 weeks a year, for 7 years straight, for a total for whopping 16800 hours.

It was never repaired, and I never opened the back cover. --- [Cleaning My MacBook After 16800 Hours of Use!](https://quanticdev.com/articles/cleaning-macbook-after-16800-hours-of-use/)
