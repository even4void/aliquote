I was a happy user of [newsboat](https://newsboat.org) until it stopped working on my MacBook, for whatever reason. It probably just works right now, but since I'm definitely out of sync with my RSS feeds, I was looking for a way to have it both on my old iPhone (this excludes de facto most modern readers, including NNW) and my MacBook. It looks like [lire](https://lireapp.com) fits the bill, although there are occasional iCloud syncing issues (sync time and rate limit). Anyway, that's still better than [Reeder](/post/reeder-app) which does not sync to iCloud at all. `#apple`
