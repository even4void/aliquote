Whenever I am looking for something about Emacs I am pretty sure I will end up
reading one of [Irreal](https://irreal.org/blog) blog posts. This time, I was wondering what's the better
way to sync an iCloud account using mu4e. Not that I am not happy with Apple
Mail, but I like having the possibility to work exclusively with Emacs, or to
process a bunch of emails using my preferred text-based workflow. The [solution](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=6119)
that seems to be working involves `mbsync`, and this looks perfectly fine to me
since I gave up on [OfflineIMAP](https://www.offlineimap.org) and switched to `mbsync` last year. `#emacs`
