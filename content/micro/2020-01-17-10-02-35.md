> I will give mathematician's credit for thinking about edge cases perhaps more than a computer scientist would. It can be easy to be a bit complacent with edge cases because the computer will likely do something even if you don't think too hard about what it ought to do. But a good computer scientist tries to reduce the number of edge cases or at least make them coherent with the non-edge cases. --- [Math is hard, let's go shopping](http://funcall.blogspot.com/2020/01/math-is-hard-lets-go-shopping.html)
