No cookies, no trackers, no Google. Probably not gluten free, though.

Apart from the recent GDPR, this site aims to remain one of the many random sites you will probably find on the internet. I used to rely on [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) as a search engine for the blog, but now there's some kind of built-in JS to allow for quick search. [Matomoto](https://matomo.org) was used for site analytics until December 2020. I only checked it once a while, and finally gave up on upgrading and looking at the stats.
