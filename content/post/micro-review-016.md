Here's the monthly review of interesting things I found while browsing Hacker News, Twitter, or RSS feeds.

- [Non-POSIX file systems](https://weinholt.se/articles/non-posix-filesystems/) is such a great piece of writing about POSIX and other filesystem, by a prolific Scheme coder.

  > Multics enabled a superior paradigm for storage management and backups. Xerox Alto allowed a disk structure to be restored even if all metadata blocks had been damaged. Hydra used a capability system to provide a powerful protection mechanism for data. All of these enabled interesting types of functionality that we are missing in POSIX.
