Here is the latest bag of tweets<sup>\*</sup>, which covers April 2019.

<!--more-->

(\*) These are interesting news that I found on Twitter and that I archive periodically. Note that I have slightly updated reporting and fetching methods so that you will get between 80 and 120 of my most recent favorites from my Twitter account (`@even4void`).

- 2019-04-01 @AchimZeileis: @JorisMeys @jonaslindeloev Also note that there are nice unifying frameworks for both parametric and nonparametric tests - without regression. E.g. the #rstats pkg "coin" combines _transformations_, _statistics_, and null _distributions_ yielding a Lego box of tests: https://t.co/0bdqL9a4Hr https://t.co/qfb5yHcmHx
- 2019-04-01 @EikoFried: "Results suggest that early hypotheses about #depression candidate #genes were incorrect &amp; that the large number of associations reported in the depression candidate gene literature are likely to be false positives".
