But to my understanding rforest and fastcforest do not produce binary splits following the same procedure. While rforest chooses the feature and the value of the feature that minimizes the MSE in the resulting child nodes, fastcforest instead splits based on a statistical test to reject the null hypothesis of independence between the dependent variable and any of the features. Is that correct?
