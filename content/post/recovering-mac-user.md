It's been a little more than 6 months that I got back to using a MacBook as my daily driver. The laptop I use is a MacBook Pro M4 14″, with 24 Go of RAM and 14 cores (10 performance + 4 efficiency; also 20 cores for the inbuilt GPU). The screen is a Retina 3024 x 1964, which I use at its default resolution It's just a beast among all of the MacBook I have own over my entire life. It's also the first Mac machine I didn't bought myself.

Still, I don't use most of what Apple offers nowadays. I don't use Apple Intelligence (ChatGPT in disguise if I understand correctly), I don't use iCloud sync for my Documents (just for casual PDFs or images I want to share with my iPhone or other machines via iCloud on the web), and above all I barely use any Mac apps except Apple Mail, Music, Photos and the Terminal.
