Simpler solution is to add this mapping to your `after/ftplugin/python.vim`: `nmap <buffer> g= :!black --quiet %<cr>:redraw!<cr>:!isort -q %<cr>:redraw!<cr>`.

> If you just want the executive summary, here it is: these are definitely interesting algorithms from an arithmetic complexity theory standpoint – especially for the case of 4×4 matrices over finite fields, where (to the best of my knowledge) Strassen’s algorithm from 1969 was still the reigning champion. These algorithms are also practically relevant, meaning that not only do they have better asymptotic lower bounds than Strassen’s algorithm, they are still algorithms you might actually use in practice, unlike essentially everything else that has been written on the topic in the last 50 years: these algorithms are correct, and will in principle win over Strassen’s algorithm with large enough matrices, but that cut-off is well beyond the sizes that anyone is actually doing computations with. --- [On AlphaTensor’s new matrix multiplication algorithms](https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2022/10/06/on-alphatensors-new-matrix-multiplication-algorithms/)<br>

Togther with [Fira Math](https://github.com/firamath/firamath), it makes for a perfect combination of fonts for handouts and slides.

> I'm definitely not in favor of fossilizing Unix, but there's a difference between avoiding fossilization and the kind of minimal, mathematical purity that we see GNU Grep trying to impose here. Unix has long since passed the point where it had that sort of minimalism in the standard commands. Modern Unix has all sorts of duplications and flourishes that aren't strictly necessary, and for good reasons. One of them is that it's nicer for the actual people using Unix. --- [We are stuck with egrep and fgrep (unless you like beating people)](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/EgrepFgrepStuckWith)<br>

> I think it all stems from Apple’s desire to simplify things for themselves, architecture-wise — Apple Silicon is quite innovative in bringing the advantages of iOS devices to Macs (performance + power efficiency). The terrible decision, in my view, has been to also want to bring the iOS look and feel to the Mac. It was unnecessary, it has broken so many tried-and-true Mac interface guidelines, and it has delivered a massive blow to the whole operating system’s identity. Just to make the Mac what, more fashionable? --- [My next Mac might be the last](https://morrick.me/archives/9667)<br>
