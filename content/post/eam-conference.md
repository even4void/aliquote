I'm back from the [VI European Congress of Methodology](http://eam2014.fss.uu.nl) that was helded in Utrecht this week.
All abstracts are <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o fa-1x"></i> [available as PDF](http://eam2014.fss.uu.nl/files/2012/06/Abstracts.pdf). I shall return to specific sessions later in August.

This is the [third]({{< ref "/post/back-from-the-iv-eam-conference.md" >}}) [time]({{< ref "/post/notes-on-the-ecm-2012-conference.md" >}}) I attend this conference, and Utrecht really is a great place. Here are some photos I took.
