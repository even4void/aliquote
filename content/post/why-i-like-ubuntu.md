A few years ago I switched to Linux after having been a fervent Mac user for over 13 years. It was like going back in time since I was a Linux user during my PhD. I didn't really miss anything when I started using [Ubuntu](/post/one-week-with-ubuntu/) as I was comfortable with the command line, and all the applications I used on the Mac mainly ran on the command line. I also installed OpenBSD on another laptop, but no other Linux boxes. Note that I did not try any other mainline or fancy Linux distros, so in this post I am only speaking of Ubuntu.
