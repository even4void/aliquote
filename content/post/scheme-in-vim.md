As a matter of fact, I use Neovim to wrote all my Chicken Scheme and Racket code. It works quite great, even if I do not have as much facilities as I had under Emacs with [Geiser].

I followed the recommendations available on Chicken [website], as well as Evan Hanson's useful blog post, [Editing Scheme in Vim], especially for completion. I found that setting `keywordprg` to `chicken-doc scheme` instead of `chicken-doc` is most of the times what I really need.

My `after/ftplugin/scheme.vim` is short enough that I can post it right in this post:

```vim
let b:is_chicken=1

setl makeprg=csc\ %

setl complete+=,k~/.local/share/scheme/words

setl include=\^\(\\(use\\\|require-extension\\)\\s\\+
setl includeexpr=substitute(v:fname,'$','.scm','')
setl path+=/home/chl/.cache/chicken-install
setl suffixesadd=.scm

setl lispwords+=let-values,condition-case,with-input-from-string
setl lispwords+=with-output-to-string,handle-exceptions,call/cc,rec,receive
setl lispwords+=call-with-output-file

fun! Scheme_indent_top_sexp()
	let pos = getpos('.')
	silent! exec 'normal! 99[(=%'
	call setpos('.', pos)
endfun

nmap <buffer> <silent> == :call Scheme_indent_top_sexp()<cr>
nmap <buffer> gs :10 split term://csi -s %<cr>:startinsert<cr>

setlocal keywordprg=chicken-doc\ scheme
```

The file `~/.local/share/scheme/words` was generated as advertised by Evan Hanson. I just use a different directory to store Scheme keywords. I update the word list periodically, especially after I install new packages.

For the time being, I'm not interested in other Scheme flavor, so I decided to target Chicken scheme only. Together with Racket, it is a solid Scheme implementation that further comes with a package manager and a nice FFI.

A final word: The `gs` mapping is something that I implemented for most languages that offer some kind of a REPL or a quick compilation process. So far, I have it implemented for the folloing filetypes:

```shell
~/.../after/ftplugin % rg "<buffer> gs"
tex.vim
29:nmap <buffer> gs :VimtexCompile<CR>

r.vim
5:nmap <buffer> gs :10 split term://Rscript %<cr>:startinsert<cr>

org.vim
10:nmap <buffer> gs :10 split term://org-babel -pdf % && zathura %:r.pdf<cr>:startinsert<cr>

c.vim
12:nmap <buffer> gs :10 split term://zig cc % && ./a.out<cr>:startinsert<cr>

rmd.vim
1:nmap <buffer> gs :w<CR>:cd %:p:h <CR>:!Rscript -e 'library(knitr);knit("%:p")'<CR>:!latexmk -pdf -bibtex-cond -f %:r.tex <CR>:!xdg-open %:r.pdf <CR><C [... 0 more matches]

rnoweb.vim
10:nmap <buffer> gs :w<CR>:cd %:p:h <CR>:!Rscript -e 'library(knitr);knit("%:p")'<CR>:!latexmk -pdf -bibtex-cond -f %:r.tex <CR>:!xdg-open %:r.pdf <CR><C [... 0 more matches]

scheme.vim
23:nmap <buffer> gs :10 split term://csi -s %<cr>:startinsert<cr>

lisp.vim
1:nmap <buffer> gs :10 split term://ros -l %<cr>:startinsert<cr>

stata.vim
3:nmap <buffer> gs :10 split term://stata -q %<cr>:startinsert<cr>

markdown.vim
9:nmap <buffer> gs :10 split term://pandoc -s --pdf-engine=lualatex --filter pandoc-fignos --filter pandoc-citeproc --listings % -o %:r.pdf && zathura % [... 0 more matches]

racket.vim
80:nmap <buffer> gs :10 split term://racket %<cr>

python.vim
8:nmap <buffer> gs :10 split term://python3 %<cr>:startinsert<cr>

haskell.vim
6:nmap <buffer> gs :10 split term://chmod +x % && ./%<cr>:startinsert<cr>

rust.vim
3:nmap <buffer> gs :10 split term://cargo run<cr>:startinsert<cr>
```

Note that I also use [iron] to launch some REPL right into a running Neovim instance.[^1] It also works great with the interactive interpreter `csi`.

Happy scheming in (Neo)vim!
