Here are a few papers that I read for the most part last month, in the CS and Stat category.

### Type Stability in Julia: Avoiding Performance Pathologies in JIT Compilation (https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01950)

I still haven't really gotten into the Julia language. I follow the news here and there and I'm glad to know that there is now a native graphical backend, not just web output. The last time I tested Julia (v1.6), I found the runtime of a first script to be quite substantial, although I understand why that is the case. The language server is slow too, because of the initial indexing of the symbols contained in all the installed packages. Nevertheless, I think Julia has a future and I hope there will soon be a consolidated set of tools for statistical modeling, much like Frank Harrell's rms package.


### An Introduction to Quantum Computing for Statisticians (https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06587)

Just out of curiosity because I was reading [Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing](https://www.thomaswong.net/introduction-to-classical-and-quantum-computing.pdf) (PDF) by Thomas G. Wong, I fetched this paper on quantum computing for statisticians.


### Aitchison's Compositional Data Analysis 40 Years On: A Reappraisal (https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05197)

It's been a long since I read a paper written by Michael Greenacre.


### How ISO C became unusable for operating systems development (https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07845)

The take-away message is that the primary reason why ISO C is poorly designed for OS development relates to a "design approach in the ISO standard that has given priority to certain kinds of optimization over both correctness and the 'high-level assembler' intentions of C, even while the latter remain enshrined in the rationale."


### Marginal Effects for Non-Linear Prediction Functions (https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08837)
