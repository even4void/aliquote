Here are a few papers that I read over the past two months, in the CS and Stat category as usual.

### Type Stability in Julia: Avoiding Performance Pathologies in JIT Compilation (https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01950)

I still haven't really gotten into the Julia language. I follow the news here and there and I'm glad to know that there is now a native graphical backend, not just web output. The last time I tested Julia (v1.6), I found the runtime of a first script to be quite substantial, although I understand why that is the case. The language server is slow too, because of the initial indexing of the symbols contained in all the installed packages. Nevertheless, I think Julia has a future and I hope there will soon be a consolidated set of tools for statistical modeling, much like Frank Harrell's [rms](https://github.com/harrelfe/rms) package. As I said in a previous post, for the moment I want to investigate Racket and Lisp-like languages, to see if they could provide a good fit for my own workflow (even if I rarely perform statistical analyses nowadays). Anyway, here's the gist of this article: Multiple dispatch is at the heart of the Julia language XXX

### An Introduction to Quantum Computing for Statisticians (https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06587)

Just out of curiosity, and because I was reading [Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing][] (PDF) by Thomas G. Wong, I fetched this paper on quantum computing for statisticians.


### Aitchison's Compositional Data Analysis 40 Years On: A Reappraisal (https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05197)

It's been a long time since I last read a paper written by Michael Greenacre. Last time was probably when I was working on multi-block methods back in 2016.


### How ISO C became unusable for operating systems development (https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07845)

The take-away message is that the primary reason why ISO C is poorly designed for OS development relates to a "design approach in the ISO standard that has given priority to certain kinds of optimization over both correctness and the 'high-level assembler' intentions of C, even while the latter remain enshrined in the rationale." A certain kind of optimization here means XXX

I still use C because this is one of the first languages I learned when I was in grad school (after Turbo Pascal, you named it). I like it because of its syntax and its simplicity, and I only write toy programs so I don't have to bother with all its "pitfalls" regarding low-level and hard-core programming. I don't use C++, but I'm rather interested in learning Rust because I like the tooling as well as [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/).


### Marginal Effects for Non-Linear Prediction Functions (https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08837)

### From p-Values to Posterior Probabilities of Hypothesis (https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06864)


### Sidenote

At the time of this writing you can replace the x in ar*x*iv URL to get a pretty HTML rendering of the article. See below for the second article discussed above.
