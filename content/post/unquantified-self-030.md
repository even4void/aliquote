Fresh new month here, November. Not much to say, so this post will be short.

I've been fiddling with my TUI config (eh, mostly Neovim) for some days and I feel better, or sort of. At least, it's now a purely homemade zero useless packages or package manager config. See [here](/post//post/vim-revamp-again/) and [there](/post/neovim-lsp-easy/) for more details.

Along the way, I've been writing and sketching a bit (charcoal straight away) but it's all very disjointed.

I watched some nice mini-series recently: [1899](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1899_(TV_series)) and [Bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodies_(2023_TV_series)). After several series of moderate quality and interest, this was refreshing indeed. I also decided I couldn't wait for my son to be ready to watch the latest season of [The Walking Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)), so I am currently watching it in the evening. I remember when he introduced me to this series: after the first episode I was like "Meh, it will not be possible to go through all those episodes this year or the year after." Finally, I liked it but I was probably biased since I liked watching it together with my son. Anyway, the show must go on.

Finally, after 3 months off, I'm back with my little city in Minecraft. Thanks to WorldEdit mod, I was able to transfer some of my previous builds onto the new map.

Side note: I can't believe I'm already at the 38th selfish post.
