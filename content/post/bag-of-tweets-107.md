Here is the latest bag of tweets<sup>*</sup>, which covers February 2019.

<!--more-->

(*) These are interesting news that I found on Twitter and that I archive periodically. Note that I have slightly updated reporting and fetching methods so that you will get between 80 and 120 of my most recent favorites from my Twitter account (`@even4void`).

- 2019-02-04 @CMastication: In case you were preparing for hosting a Super Bowl party tonight and missed the very brief academic econ language war, below is the summary. #rstats #python #stata The most amusing thing to me was that nobody even bothered to mention SAS. https://t.co/teFtziknes
- 2019-02-04 @jepusto: Hey Econ tweeps arguing about R vs Stata. I did Stata during Undergrad, SAS + Stata as an analyst (pre-grad school), and then learned R. I‚Äôm a statistician so admittedly on the periphery of the flame wars, but here‚Äôs my two cents anyways...

- 2019-02-06 @jeremyfreese: Regarding R vs. Stata debates, what I would love to see is race between fast &amp; fluent Stata users and fast &amp; fluent R users to perform bunch of ordinary data analysis tasks. I've always thought Stata folks will be (much?) faster but am open-minded that this is wrong/parochial.
- 2019-02-06 @SolomonKurz: 1/n Someone asked me recently what resources I‚Äôd recommend for furthering one‚Äôs introduction to Bayesian statistics after going through @rlmcelreath's text (https://t.co/t9T2q6hGay) and my accompanying project (https://t.co/alBJXHKIrf).   Here are my thoughts:

- 2019-02-07 @CMastication: @_J_sinclair @hugobowne In my Airflow process I have a shell script that changes the working directory then runs a script.

- 2019-02-12 @iLemming: @magit_emacs tip: you can selectively take things from a stash, simply press `a` - (magit-apply).   Sometimes though it won't work because of conflicts.
