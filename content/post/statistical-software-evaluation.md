Long ago there were some folks who were complaining that R was not "certified", as SAS was, for example, in the pharmaceutical industry. No one talked about Stata, if I remember correctly, but in any case the [certification](https://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=pr0001) is fully documented, including [detailed results](https://www.stata.com/support/cert/nist/) obtained against the NIST StRDâ€”Standard Reference Data. But what does certification really mean?
