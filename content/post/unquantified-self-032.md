Yet another one of these posts to reflect on recent moments in my life. I just finisehd watching Season 2 of the [House of the Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Dragon). It was great and I am now just awaiting the third Season. I wouldn't say it's on the same level as Game of Thrones, but maybe it's that there's less of a profusion of characters, which makes House of the Dragons more intimate and closer to a classic series or mini-series. I watched other mini-series previously but only [The Queen's Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen%27s_Gambit_(miniseries)) and [Ripley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripley_(TV_series)) get my attention.

This site has been pretty quiet for the past 3 months, partly because of the busy workload, but also because of a lack of motivation. I took the opportunity to read a lot of [books](/files/books.txt) and draw whatever came to mind, or sometimes to mind. An excerpt follows.

I still [want it darker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nmHymgM7Y) as he said.

Anyway, the good thing is that I'm on holidays, for a good two weeks yet. I needed this to disconnect from everything, to recompose myself in a way. I'm afraid it's not going to get any better -- just turned 50, still alive.

I finally decided it was time to update the base colors of the site. Everything remains the same except for the background color of the body and note. I acknowledged source of inspiration in the [Changelog](/changelog). I also added rounded corner to code blocks, but I still don't want to provide syntax highlighting. I like it when it's just black & white, with bold statements, like in my text editor. I'm becoming increasingly allergic to garish colors and uniform white. Speaking of _the_ text editor (Neovim), I reworked my config once again, as described in [this post](/post/neovim-revamped/), but there was more to come later on. I ended up with an even more dry setup, based on 6 plugins but a lot of hand crafted VimL functions and settings.

```shell
~/.config/nvim
» tree -L 3 pack
pack
└── plugins
    ├── opt
    │   ├── neogen
    │   ├── rustaceanvim
    │   └── vim-table-mode
    └── start
        ├── fzf-lua
        ├── nvim-treesitter
        └── nvim-treesitter-textobjects

9 directories, 0 files
```

That being said, if it hadn't been for treesitter and the terminal facilities, I could have started from scratch with vim 9, [ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) and [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim).

There are so many drafts waiting for me that I'd better get some rest...
