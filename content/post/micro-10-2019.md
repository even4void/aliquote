<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-10-01</a>: Well, we need to balance the tutorials, so let's dive into [Just Enough Emacs Lisp](https://tech.tonyballantyne.com/emacs-workout/just-enough-emacs-lisp/) now. `#emacs`<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-10-02</a>: > Il écrit de la main droite. Dans le toorent, il a laissé pendre la gauche, massée et alanguie d'eau froide. Il est vigilant comme un pêcheur qui surveille son bouchon. Il veut tenter de rendre, de la pointe de la plume, les baisers de l'eau renouvelée qui lave elle-même son baiser. --- Régine Detambel, Petit éloge de la peau<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-10-02</a>: I believe this the canonical way to filter in a Pandas data frame, say `d`, rows that contain or better, match exactly, the word "gene":`pythond[d["type"].str.match("gene", na=False)]`<small>(The `na=False` option is just because there are some NaN values.)</small>Now I understand why I prefer functional languages, and more specifically why I prefer to write and chain together simple functions in Python rather than implementing complex class with shadowed methods, setters and getters. `#python`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-10-02</a>: I'm using `ox-pandoc` as my main engine to export Org documents to HTML or PDF. This is mostly because I know Pandoc better than the basic (Lua)Latex + Minted/`lstlistings` that I haven't used in years. Funny enough, the `#+ATTR_LATEX` is not recognized by Pandoc, but part of `#+ATTR_HTML` settings (e.g., `:width 75%` to resize image) are honored during the export. However, neither of the HTML or PDF output include the `#+CAPTION:` legend! `#emacs` `#org`<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-10-03</a>: Oh I guess [my remark](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr/issues/410) became totally useless since `lintr` 2.0.0 came out on CRAN recently. I should note that old options are still valid, though, so I can keep the following in my `init.el` file:`emacs-lisp(flycheck-lintr-linters"with_defaults(assignment_linter=NULL, camel_case_linter=NULL, commented_code_linter=NULL,absolute_paths_linter=NULL, line_length_linter(120))")`Not that I am a big fan of camel case, but Bioconductor folks are apparently. `#rstats` `#emacs`<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-10-07</a>: If you like reading about others' setup, _Uses This_ has a nice interview with [Chris Wellons](https://usesthis.com/interviews/chris.wellons/). Apparently, there's also a [quick review](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8354) on Irreal.

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-10-08</a>: I finally got my Bitbucket account back. Just so I could delete the dozens of repositories I maintained over the years there. This is a very bad user experience since I cannot delete my account and don't have any clue, even after reading the docs and the commnunity wiki. I guess I now have to contact the support center.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-10-08</a>: I started watching [Euphoria](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)>) yesterday evening. It's been a long since I haven't watched a TV show alone. And the pilot was quite good actually.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-10-08</a>: MacOS Catalina is out, apparently. What's up now? Should I stay or should I come and see what they made to iTunes?

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-10-08</a>: Well, I find it weird that Apple products are [more expensive in France](https://lemire.me/blog/2019/10/07/the-price-of-a-macbook-air-worldwide/). Conversely, I experienced a lot of trouble with taxes when buying Stata books from the US. Anyway, I no longer can afford any Apple product by myself, so I guess I'll have to keep my finger crossed in hoping that my current Macbook will last a few more years. `#apple`<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-10-14</a>: After upgrading Ubuntu and R on the server at work, I'm now looking for an optimal Mac->Linux iTerm+Tmux+ssh thing. I'm close. In the meantime, I found this: [My remote shell session setup](https://blog.filippo.io/my-remote-shell-session-setup/), but I believe `mosh` is not the [recommended way](https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/wikis/tmux-Integration-Best-Practices) anymore.

Look to satisfy your customers’ needs before your own. --- [Plain Text Emails, Please](https://uglyduck.ca/plain-text-emails/)<br>

I've been diving with Zsh long before it became the _de facto_ shell on macOS, and I just moved again, this time for [Fish](/post/fish-shell). However, there's always something nice to learn from Scripting OS X, so I'll keep this in my bookmarks, especially since I still use zsh occasionally (because of Emacs multi-term which doesn't seem to like Fish very much).
