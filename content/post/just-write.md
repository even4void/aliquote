I noticed recently on several blogs I follow (e.g. [Jan Lukas Else](https://jlelse.blog/links/2020/05/reddit-hnblogs/)) that a recent [HN thread](https://jlelse.blog/links/2020/05/reddit-hnblogs/) made it to the top with a discussion on the death of blogging.

> All of the above makes newcomers to go directly to social networks and not to independent blogs. We also have to consider that as the author says, it is hard to find blogs, and if you write almost nobody reads your blog, while on Instagram you can get hundreds of followers. <br>That is not going to change, that is what big companies are looking for, that is what they are pushing for. The Internet has changed. --- [Blogging is not dead](https://www.garron.blog/en/blog/blogging.html)

I don't think blogging ever vanished with time --- on the contrary, there's a plethora of tools for blogging these days, either using a CMS or static blog generators. Blog content has evolved, though, and the lifespan of blogs shows a high variability. I would even say that there's a higher volatility. As one would expect, the more content you can find on a website, the more likely it is here to stay for a while. In the past I subscribed to several interesting blogs that disappeared after their author finished his PhD thesis or switch to another job position. Sometimes the blog remains, but the RSS feed remains empty for years. We can't ask people to continue writing when they don't have time or when they are no longer interested, or simply when they are [done with their blog](https://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/2013/12/16/the-end/). That's life after all! More importantly we can't fight with Twitter, Instagram and social aggregators like HN, or even paid blogging platform (e.g., Medium). Here's why RSS probably matters: you can create our own personal list of feeds and stayed informed of what's going on about your preferred blogs without having to worry about finding that very nice URL you bookmarked a while back.

I too have my ups and downs (for the last 2 years it's been more of an ups) but I never force myself to write, nor to produce necessarily perfect material. I don't have any schedule, and I may happen to write 5 posts in a row while leaving the site derelict for weeks on end. Originally, this blog was mainly used to record what I was installing on my computer, but also to take some notes I took when reading scientific stuff. With time it evolved either as a lab notebook or simply as a list of annotated bookmarks and reading notes. I've been recently splitting the blog in two parts, a micro blog and the present blog which aims at hosting longer posts. I don't check statistics regularly, but usually this site is visited by around 35-70 persons each day. That's okay. I don't expect much and I am already happy to have some readers.

As suggested by Guillermo Garron, the solution is probably to "[Just. Write.](https://100daystooffload.com)"
