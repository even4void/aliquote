It's already February. It also looks like Spring is coming, at least on my balcony:

We started watching a new TV show with my son, [See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See_(TV_series)). I originally thought it would make a good sequel to Vikings, but this was only based on the poster of the TV show on Apple TV. Now that I realized that the main characters are all blind, I find the series even more interesting. When my son is not with me, I'm just back to the basics: I [read](/files/books.txt) or watch Twitch, mostly [strager](https://www.twitch.tv/togglebit) and [togglebit](https://www.twitch.tv/togglebit) --- give them a follow, you won't regret it. I still listen to music all day long, and my latest streak according to Last.fm was around 1000 tracks a week.

As discussed in one of my previous posts, I'm pretty happy with my current setup. Indeed I switched to Regolith desktop and I can now enjoy a useable window manager and Ubuntu built-in stuff (with a revamped GTK theme). This means I'm also back to a dark theme for my TUI stack, but I kept Firefox untouched because all dark theme I came across look so bad for most websites with lot of pictures or complex layout.

Other than that, I remained diligent in the kitchen:

That's all for now!
