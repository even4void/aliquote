> WhatsApp rose by trapping previously-free beings in their corral and changing their habits to create dependence on masters. Over time, this made it difficult or impossible to return to their previous lifestyle. That process should sound familiar: it’s eerily similar to the domestication of animals. I call this type of vendor lock-in user domestication: the removal of user autonomy to trap users into serving vendors. --- [WhatsApp and the domestication of users](https://seirdy.one/2021/01/27/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users.html)<br>

I still can write a complete website using HTML and basic CSS without looking at Google (or DuckDuckGo for what matters). Likewise, I can use Sed, Awk and shell scripts, or write R and Python code without relying on a search engine. However, I must admit that I became so lazy over the years that I found myself googling for everything nearly available in the help, man or info pages that sit on my computer. That's a shame, of course. Laziness and muscle memory are the problem. We should probably refrain ourselves from googling again and again. That's not a way to learn.<br>

> There are plenty of books on how to become a better programmer out there. Books like this tend to have checklists and other advice that the author deems important enough for you to do in order to become a better programmer. They tend to focus on specific improvements like choosing a better editor, writing better test cases, or drinking lots of water. Those books have lots of useful advice, but they read like a laundry list of things that you must do all at once in order to succeed. This book will try not to saddle you with more work (you likely have enough as it is). Rather, we'll discuss what it feels like to be a programmer. --- [What is The Mediocre Programmer?](http://themediocreprogrammer.com/what-is-the-mediocre-programmer.html#what-is-the-mediocre-programmer)<br>

> My impression now is that they feel like it has too many cool new things; and that a few things didn’t quite make it in even with the extended release cycle. So it’s looking likely to me that 1.7 will actually be the LTS; but that it might also be a feature release – possibly this time a much shorter release period than usual. In practice I think for a lot of package maintainers 1.6 will be a LTS, in that that is the oldest version they will make sure to continue to support. There have been too many cool new things (as this post will detail) to stay back to only 1.0 features. Already a lot of packages have dropped support for Julia versions older than 1.3. --- [Julia 1.6: what has changed since Julia 1.0?](https://www.oxinabox.net/2021/02/13/Julia-1.6-what-has-changed-since-1.0.html)<br>
