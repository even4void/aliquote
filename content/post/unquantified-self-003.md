Surely we can say that the Summer is over but it has been quite pleasant this year. We still have beautiful days, even if it gets colder (at least for me).
 
I've spent the whole Summer with my son, and we manage to watch a lot of TV shows, including the full series of [The Walking Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)) and [Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones). We are now watching Prison Break, but at a closer pace following the return to "ordinary life". No matter what happens, as long as we find the time to be together. He also inherited a completely renovated room!

I've read a lot of books in September (see the reading list which is partially ahead of what I am currently reading), including beautiful works of art by Andr√©e Chedid or Patti Smith, *Un jour* (David Smith) or *Je voudrais que la nuit me prenne* (Isabelle Desesquelle).

Last month I decided to start drawing and writing again but I haven't taken the plunge yet. That being said, I have a lot of pencils now. I also bought two [TWSBI fountain pens](https://www.twsbi.com) after having read one of the [latest post](https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/twsbi-go-fountain-pen/) by BSAG. The TWSBI Diamond Mini is incredibly delightful and it reminds me of the pleasure I always had to write with my old Sheaffer on [Apica CD11 notebooks](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/apica-cd-11-notebook-navy-lined).

What else? Cooking, again...

Last but not least, I learned that a frangipani can bloom again.
