Here is the traditional post from the end of my working year.

I just realized that it is the first time since 4 years that I didn't attend any conference during the Summer. Well, I was quite buzy in July, before being off for one month. I generally take the opportunity to find one or two conferences where we can go in family.  This should have been the [58th World Statistics ISI Congress](http://www.isi2011.ie/content/) <i class="fa fa-chain-broken fa-1x"></i> held in Dublin. Alas, this year I have to take care of my 17 yrs. old cat...

Well, I didn't move a lot, just a few days in the South of France. We had good time even though. Here are some pics from Cathy's garden:

Anyway, I am listening to the latest tracks from Les Ogres de Barback, [Comment je suis devenu voyageur](http://www.deezer.com/fr/music/les-ogres-de-barback/comment-je-suis-devenu-voyageur-759123), while trying to cleaning things up on my website and my hard drive. It's hard work because I have had a very intensive year, and I have accumulated plenty of stuff everywhere on my HD. Moreover, I initiated a lot of projects that aren't finished yet. But I'm afraid given the time I have before returning to work, it won't be finished until... next year? This was a year where I find myself almost always chating on the web (1,5k+ tweets, 450+ responses on StackExchange sites, 60+ posts on <http://www.aliquote.org>), athough it was also quite productive with 5 or 6 working papers.
