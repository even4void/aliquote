Long time no see. Little update for the `#self` tag.

Today, I'm particularly happy because I'll be spending another evening with my son and we will probably watch [Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones). I also bought the latest season of [The Walking Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)) so we shouldn't be left out of TV shows for the coming weeks. And of course I look forward to [The Expanse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)) (Season 3) coming on the iTunes store. Public holidays are ending, but we will hopefully find time to watch them all! In the meantime, we also watched all five [Jason Bourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Bourne) movies, as well as [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix).

On my end, I'm getting used to a new life in a research lab. I've spent 15 years outside, so it took a longer time than initially expected. Plus, I have to deal with unexpected effects of my illness, as well as long-lasting side-effects of my medication. Nothing really interesting, just to say. Either way, I'm really lucky I ended up there since people are really friendly and welcoming. I hope I will be able to stay for some months or even years in this lab before the disease recovers.

I have been quite calm regarding music and books later. Partly because of my working hard to get things done at some point, and also because I spent the last two weeks in weightlessness: No idea why, I suddenly became a human wreck, unable to stand up without feeling dizzy, and extremely tired -- e.g., I spent three days in a row in a bed, but this state of despondency lasted 10 days. Nobody cares, even me I believe, but it leaves its mark. Hopefully, things will get better with time (or cannot be worst anyway).

I don't mind the wether, but if it could get warmer for more than 5 days, I would be happy at some point. I remember my outdoor lunches a few weeks ago, and then a cold snap. Not really funny.

What else? My desocialization phase has reached its peak: I hardly see anyone anymore. That's ok. I don't have any plan.
