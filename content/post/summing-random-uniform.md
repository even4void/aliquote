[Chris Wellons] one asked the following question before providing some code to estimate the result, which I call brute force estimate but I do it a lot too:

> How many times should a random number from [0, 1] be drawn to have it sum over 1?

Here is my brute force approach using Racket: (also, no formatting at all, I said "brute force"!)

```racket
#lang racket

(define xs (for/vector #:length 100 ([i (in-range 100)]) (random)))
(for/vector

```

How about the math? There are several solutions available on math.SO, [more] or [less] complicated.
