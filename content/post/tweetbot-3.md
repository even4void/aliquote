Since Twitter [withdrawned its native Twitter client](https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/964635739517407232) from OS X a while back, I had to find a new application to replace this handy app, and I settled to [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/).

To be honest, I read [some reviews](https://tidbits.com/2018/03/02/three-alternatives-to-twitters-now-defunct-mac-app/) before deciding which app to choose. At that time, most people were lurking into Tweetdeck, Twitteriffic, or Tweetbot. All that I knew was that I won't be using a web app like Tweetdeck so I decided to try Tweetbot. I do not use Twitter on my Desktop a lot, except for grabbing images or read bookmarked threads. Indeed, I mostly reading Twitter from my iPhone, and as always Twitter is more of a Pinterest to me than a social tool. So any native app that would bring me back the basic functionalities I had with the preceding app would fit the bill.

And now it just happened: I updated to Tweetbot 3 after having played with Tweetbot 2 for a month or so. Tweetbot makes me feel like I am using the old Twitter native app (even if I now have to pay for using it) and that's probably a reasonable choice for what I use Twitter for. On the plus side, it has some additional features that makes interacting with Twitter enjoyable again.

What I like so far:

- Light and dark theme: even if the white vs. night theme has long been debated regarding text editors, I still like the idea I am able to switch from dark on white theme during the day to white on black late at night. [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org) offers a convenient shortcut to switch from one theme to the next one in a list of predefined themes, and I use a similar approach with [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs). I do not have much to say about theory, that's just the way I like it best.
- Expandable columns with drag and drop support: you have to know that, but you can simply add new columns by dragging to the right the little icon that pop up in the bottom right corner of the app.
- Quick and handy timeline and user filters: what else to say? It is now clear that Twitter is full of Ads or boring speeches that you just want to hear from.
- Fullscreen support, which using Apple [split view](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204948) mode for fullscreen apps, makes it incredibly easy to have Twitter and any Newsfeed reader side by side (below is an example with [Reeder](/post/reeder-app)).
- Account management: it is quite easy to add or remove lists or even mute filters from the "My Account" pane.
