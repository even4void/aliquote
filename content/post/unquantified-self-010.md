Latest news from the Summer here.

<!--more-->

Days have been pretty quite because I was on holidays during the last five weeks, half time ill but that's ok, I'm used to being in a second state now. The hot weather didn't help---we reached 42°C one day!---and, anyway, I didn't really want to program on my computer anymore so I took some rest. I'm back pushing to Github and reading a lot of articles on genetics and functional programming. I could almost enjoy it if I weren't so tired when I get back at home after day job. But let's not dwell on these bad thoughts, I'm not often optimistic lately.

I took advantage of these few days to read as much as I could, very irregularly, but always with great pleasure anyway. Here are the titles: Denis Michelis, _Etat d'ivresse_ (Notabila); Ségolène Daignies, _Piano destinato_ (Mercure de France); Haruki Murakami, _Sommeil_ (10/18); Clélie Avit, _L'expérience de la pluie_ (Plon); Christian Grindicelli, _Station balnéaire_ (Gallimard); Joël Bastard, _Des lézards, des liqueurs_ (Gallimard); Orhan Pamuk, _La femme aux cheveux roux_ (Gallimard); Yannick Haenel, _Tiens ferme ta couronne_ (Gallimard); Erri De Luca, _La tour de l'Oie_ (Gallimard); Ricarda Huch, _Le dernier été_ (Viviane Hamy); Thierry Laget, _Proust, prix Goncourt_ (Gallimard); Laetitia Colombani, _Les victorieuses_ (Grasset); Antonio Moresco, _La petite lumière_ (Verdier); Anaïs Nin, _Une espionne dans la maison de l'amour_ (Stock).
