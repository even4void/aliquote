While listening to a nice compilation of [Jazz Chill](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/jazz-chill/pl.63271312c084419891982eab46cc68ac) (no sponsoring, my Macbook mostly became my private juke box since I switched to Ubuntu), I was thinking of how my web reading habits evolved with time. Back in 2010 I was learning a lot of useful tips almost every day and I collected thousands of bookmarks in, say, 8-9 years. Nowadays, there's nothing left on Twitter except personal timeline I like to follow from time to time. I always have had an RSS feed reader since 2008, but it is now my primary source of information and I don't even have to leave my terminal for reading well posed and interesting blog posts.

Looking at the tags I have in [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/), I realize half of the blog I follow are about Unix, Emacs and Vim, and Lisp. The remaining feeds are all about statistics, mathematics, infosec and web dev. Back in 2010, 80% of my feeds were about R and statistics. I cleaned up most of the R feeds I was following, and many statisticians I was following no longer maintain their website. I keep reading some of these old real gems (e.g., [John D. Cook](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/)'s blog) since 2010, though. And I renewed my reading list, of course. I have little confidence in the sustainability of some websites hosted on github.io, but right now I'm happy with my reading list. I estimate that around 15% of the feeds I have are dead by now, but that's okay. There's the history in plain text on my hard drive in case I want to read old posts of theirs.

Needless to say, I can understand why some of them quit. With the advent of social networks, blogging platforms (e.g., Medium), Github gists etc., it has become easier and easier to communicate without investing too much time and energy into long time sustainaibility. After all, those platforms should take care of keeping your writings "alive", and if you don't have much time or inclination to continue, you can leave it there. It's just as exciting to start writing on a blog as it is easy to forget to update it. This kind of consideration has often happened to me in the past. Also, interests can change from one day to the next, professional activities and family life also change. I'm not blaming those folks who wrote wonderful content and stop one day. After all, we must be happy for what happened, and not be sad when the story ends.

That being said, here's the state of affairs as of 2021.
