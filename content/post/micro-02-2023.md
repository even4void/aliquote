<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-02-06</a>: Best way to learn about recent (non-breaking) changes in [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is to rerun your old R code. Now I know that :

```
Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0. Please use `linewidth` instead.The `<scale>` argument of `guides()` cannot be `FALSE`. Use "none" instead as of ggplot2 3.3.4.
```

Other than that, I found that the `theme_minimal()` is as good as the `hrbrthemes:theme_ipsum`. Less dependencies, clear and elegant graphical output.<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-02-07</a>: I just made my GH [biostats](https://github.com/even4void/biostats) public, just so you know how I like playing with translating R code to other languages, without any hope of finishing this new side project anytime soon. Details in this longer [blog post](/post/biostatistical-methods/). Want some crazy plots? Go to the `figs` directory in each language and compare the output. Be aware this is highly work-in-progress, as advertised on the GH repo, and there are many bugs lying around. Anyway, no more raw Matplotlib for me, I felt in love with [plotnine](/post/python-plotnine/).<br>

> The GIL is a major obstacle to concurrency. For scientific computing tasks, this lack of concurrency is often a bigger issue than speed of executing Python code, since most of the processor cycles are spent in optimized CPU or GPU kernels. The GIL introduces a global bottleneck that can prevent other threads from making progress if they call any Python code. There are existing ways to enable parallelism in CPython today, but those techniques come with significant limitations (see Alternatives). --- [PEP 703 – Making the Global Interpreter Lock Optional in CPython](https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-02-08</a>: I've been following Darren Wilkinson's work for a long time now, and even if I'm not really interested in Scala I keep checking his blog and GitHub from time to time. He just released a course on functional programming for scientific computing, available at GH. Go check his blog to learn more: [An introduction to functional programming for scalable statistical computing and machine learning](https://darrenjw.wordpress.com/2023/02/04/an-introduction-to-functional-programming-for-scalable-statistical-computing-and-machine-learning/).<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-02-08</a>: [Shells are Two Things](https://borretti.me/article/shells-are-two-things). The Python scripting example reminds me of a blog post written by Mathias Fußenegger who uses Haskell in interpreted mode as one of his scripting engine (see [Why Haskell became my favorite scripting language](https://zignar.net/2021/07/09/why-haskell-became-my-favorite-scripting-language/)), even if this totally unrelated to the points raised by Fernando Borretti.<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-02-18</a>: I recently came across some Racket code on [Reddit][] that implements Fenwick trees, aka binary indexed trees (BIT). Fenwick's article, which is not the original paper on that particular data structure, [A New Data Structure for Cumulative Frequency Tables][] (PDF) explains all the details, but there's also a [nice tutorial][], as well as some [applications][] for competitive programming.

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-02-20</a>: The highest upvotes I got on Cross Validated is for a quick reply where I mentioned the Gifi "nom de plume", which I miss a lot. Enjoy your "unfinished" retirement, Mr./Dr. [Jan de Leeuw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_de_Leeuw), and happy [*foo*metrics](https://aliquote.org/cours/2011_health_measures/03-psychometrics_screen.pdf) (PDF)!

> If Foo is a science then Foo often has both an area Foometrics and an area Mathematical Foo. Mathematical Foo applies mathematical modeling to the Foo subject area, while Foometrics develops and studies data analysis techniques for empirical data collected in Foo. Each of the social and behavioural sciences has a form of Foometrics, although they may not all use a name in this family. --- de Leeuw, 2006<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-02-20</a>: The thing I really appreciate under Ubuntu or OpenBSD compared to macOS is the package manager.

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-02-23</a>: I successfully installed Forge and Controllable for the Minecraft (Java Edition) running on my laptop. Now I can use a PS5 controller to play instead of keyboard shortcuts. Okay, it must be 5 years since I last played, but I'm glad to find a game environment close to the PS4. Sadly, I can't play my old PS4 maps on the Java edition, which means I need to create a new one.<br>![img](/img/2023-02-23-12-27-06.png)<br>
