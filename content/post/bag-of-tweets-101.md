Here is the latest bag of tweets<sup>\*</sup>, which covers August 2018.

<!--more-->

(\*) These are interesting news that I found on Twitter and that I archive periodically. Note that I have slightly updated reporting and fetching methods so that you will get between 80 and 120 of my most recent favorites from my Twitter account (`@chlalanne`).

- 2018-08-28 @mbostock: Recreated a @jasondavies favorite, World Airports Voronoi, using @recifs new spherical Delaunay prototype! üòç https://t.co/mMm1PouiFk
- 2018-08-03 @mbostock: Deriving the nearest neighbor graph from the Delaunay triangulation. https://t.co/TWzwoDn7OB
- 2018-08-08 @mbostock: If you like this, you might also like @jasondavies‚Äô animation of a rapidly-exploring random tree. https://t.co/mKJp3IL6cq
- 2018-08-03 @MattDowle: My slides from #JSM2018 yesterday now on the wiki https://t.co/lJtAp8R7eK #rdatatable https://t.co/VhFNXv7TOJ
- 2018-08-22 @rlmcelreath: Still seeing researchers rejecting Bayes bc priors make them uncomfortable. If you don't like priors, then don't use Bayes. But you must do something to control overfitting. And that something will act a lot like a prior. https://t.co/FAZdcDS4B7
- 2018-08-17 @rlmcelreath: Some suggestions, but others may follow up with more/better. Stan case studies: https://t.co/EqynsUsPpf Read BDA3: https://t.co/KP4k3yf83C Stan manual model examples: https://t.co/WqVs7SZ4iG Stan forums contain lots of wisdom/examples: https://t.co/tpxAB7M3Es https://t.co/yetIg1OTSe
- 2018-08-02 @bradleyboehmke: This latest tutorial reviews the iml #rstats package by @ChristophMolnar for #MachineLearning interpretability with @h2oai. Probably the most comprehensive pkg for global and local model-agnostic methods. https://t.co/7aZ2vW7zG1
- 2018-08-04 @mattdesl: Some nice early pen plotter &amp; computer artworks on exhibit in the V&amp;A in London right now. Many of the pieces are from the 1960s and 70s, including work by Vera Molnar, Georg Nees, Frieder Nake and others. Only two rooms but great to see nonetheless. https://t.co/SeOfGqlnQ0
- 2018-08-30 @revodavid: With BERT (https://t.co/ln1oYJRJw0), you can run R functions from Excel's formula bar. This and other great R/Excel tips from the guide by @alycolumbus https://t.co/4l6UqIgmjV #rstats https://t.co/VurjJLEzr7
- 2018-08-04 @\_wilfredh: Exploring JVM extensions to add proper reified generics to Java! You'll be able to distinguish List&lt;Integer&gt; from List&lt;String&gt; (i.e. not just type erasure). https://t.co/lvqTcuTgBh
- 2018-08-07 @\_wilfredh: Excellent, interesting blog post on how Rust's cargo does version resolution, why it favours the latest compatible version, and the tradeoffs in this space. https://t.co/oCbVonAOpN
- 2018-08-25 @\_wilfredh: Common Lisp is the only language where I've seen other languages implemented on top. Today I saw an awk implementation! https://t.co/YIqdv6MPov Racket comes close (and has great tooling) but I've not seen anything like the Python implementation on CL.
- 2018-08-22 @\_wilfredh: Integers in Emacs Lisp are now arbitrary size, not just 32/64-bit! https://t.co/eN3NhEVDOl
- 2018-08-27 @\_wilfredh: Intriguing post by @Chis_Andrei exploring the use of unit tests to provide live examples of objects to demonstrate APIs. He even shows a notebook style UI and exploring related code! https://t.co/QsgK3ip8YU

- 2018-08-09 @olebegemann: I wrote another post about migrating an Objective-C class to Swift, discussing a great suggestion from @jegnux: why not use subclassing? https://t.co/9CSlsFle01

- 2018-08-01 @olebegemann: Even if you‚Äôre not a @pointfreeco subscriber, it‚Äôs worth taking the 40 minutes to watch their (free) ‚ÄúA Tour of Point-Free‚Äù episode. Lots of great ideas and inspiration for writing safer code, taking advantage of playgrounds, etc. https://t.co/VY2DGmc61J
