The last entry in this series was in October, four months ago. Not much has changed, I guess, with the exception of an exceptionally long-lasting and painful fatigue from time to time.

No more drawing, at least for the time being. I took a few days off to rest and take a break from the daily routine. I watched three movies and I only appreciated one ([Jung_e](https://www.netflix.com/title/81465109)), sort of. TV shows are still listed on their own page, but I must admit I haven't found anything very exciting.

As advertised [recently](/micro/2023-02-23-12-12-36/), I configured my Minecraft (Java Edition) installation to allow for the use of an USB PS5 controller. This was easier than I originally thought since you just need to install the latest [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) for your current version of MC and then the [Controllable](https://mrcrayfish.com/mods?id=controllable) mod. However, my son who is more versed into PVP needed MC 1.8.9, so I looked for the corresponding version of Forge (1.8.9-forge1.8.9-11.15.1.2318-1.8.9) but I didn't find any relevant version for the controller mod. Hopefully, there's Joypad-Mod-1.8.9.jar which you can find [here](https://www.9minecraft.net/joypad-mod/). You will likely need to ensure that the controller is activated and also reconfigure the default settings.

A screenshot lost in my files follows, which is one of my last screenshots on [Last.fm](/post/one-year-scrobbling/). I heard about [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) but finally I think I'm fine with [cmus](/post/cmus/) and [mpv](https://mpv.io/), and everything is going well on the music side, I still have to listen to 7-8 hours a day.
