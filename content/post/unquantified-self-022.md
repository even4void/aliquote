Things are growing, outside. Compare those two pictures, taken two months apart:

It's already April and I feel like I haven't written that much. Neither on this blog, nor on my digital notebook by the way. Anyway, time passes even if it is not to catch up with it. Regarding side projects, I still have in mind the idea of writing a statistical library for Scheme. It will probably target Racket and/or Chicken Scheme. I started playing again with the latter, which is now Chicken 5. I first learned about Chicken Scheme more than 10 years on Jan de Leeuw's tech listserv. I played with it a little bit, but that's all. Now that I reinstalled it, reread the documentation, and discovered that the IRC room is pretty active on Libera.chat, I thought it would be a good idea to investigate more time into the language itself. I don't really like Chez Scheme for it lacks tooling and packaging (although there are some external package managers, e.g., [akku], but see [Travis Hankelman]).

My son and I discovered we missed some episodes of [The Walking Dead], Season 10. Things are now settled since we just finished watching them the night before last. We now just have to find our way thru Season 11.
