Back to reading feeds. Here is a vrief review of the [Reeder app](http://reederapp.com).

<!--more-->

For somewhat different reasons that evolved over time, I stopped using a feed reader at some point, then never looked back. I knew where to find interesting posts and I was just browsing them on Safari. Thanks to Twitter, I also get in touch with the "rest of the world", whatever it means given that I no longer have any public conversation these days. This all started with [Google Reader](https://googleblog.blogspot.fr/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html) shutting down back in 2013. Then it was [Prismatic](https://venturebeat.com/2015/12/11/prismatic-is-shutting-down-its-news-app-for-ios-android-and-web-on-december-20/) that stopped working and I was left like many others with [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/welcome). Feedly was really great, and it allows a smoother experience compared to the built-in Safari RSS reader. I used to use a combination of both during two years. Now, with the latest version of OS X (High Sierra), Safari RSS reader is dead. 

However, I never really liked web application, and I have always preferred native app when one was available and not too expensive. Reeder is not free, it costs money, but it remains affordable if like me you prefer truly native look'n feel and settings.

First of all, you don't have to start again from scratch and you can import the feeds you stored on Feedly without any problem. This also applies to other popular reader like Instapaper or Feedbin.
