[Matthew Drury][] made a great job explaining how eigenvalues are usually computed, via the QR decomposition. This is an iterative algorithm which is available in Numpy, `numpy.linalg.qr`, while in R it is directly `qr`. We already discussed the QR decomposition in a [previous post][]. Basically, the idea is as follows: Let $X$ be a symmetric matrix, compute $X_k = Q_kR_k$, for $k=1,\dots,n$, and update $X_{k+1}=R_kQ_k$. The sequence of $X_n$ converges to a diagonal matrix $D$ of eigenvalues, such that the eigenvectors are the columns of $\prod_i Q_i$.

In Racket, using an example from [Rosetta][] we would write:

```racket
(require math)
(matrix-qr (matrix [[12 -51   4]
                    [ 6 167 -68]
                    [-4  24 -41]]))
```

for(i in 1:30)
{
d <- qr(X);
Q <- qr.Q(d);
pQ <- pQ %_% Q;
X <- qr.R(d) %_% Q;
}

X = eigevvalues
pQ = eigenvectors
