<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2022-09-04</a>: Trying out [Tactile](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4548/tactile/) as an additional Window Manager for Gnome shell. Looks great. No auto-tiling (you have to manually assign new windows to predefined tiles on a grid, but this is flexible. However, it works like a charm right (and out of the box), unlike Forge or gTile. Gnome default tiling behavior works alongside, which is great. Together with Simple terminal or Gnome terminal (preferred), this makes for a great tiling WM. Also, none of the shell extensions (Unite, undecorate, ...) I tried were able to properly remove window decorations, and it seems like there always are edge cases anyway.<br>![img](/img/2022-09-04-11-15-36.png)<br>

> The historical justification for a /bin, /sbin and /lib separate from /usr no longer applies today. They were split off to have selected tools on a faster hard disk (which was small, because it was more expensive) and to contain all the tools necessary to mount the slower /usr partition. Today, a separate /usr partition already must be mounted by the initramfs during early boot, thus making the justification for a split-off moot. In addition a lot of tools in /bin and /sbin in the status quo already lost the ability to run without a pre-mounted /usr. There is no valid reason anymore to have the operating system spread over multiple hierarchies, it lost its purpose. --- [The Case for the /usr Merge](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/TheCaseForTheUsrMerge/)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2022-09-08</a>: Tip of the day: If you want to get ride of Ubuntu putting screenshots with arbitrary filenames in arbitrary folder, without resorting on the good old `gnome-screenshot` tool, just use:

```shell
% xdg-user-dirs-update --set PICTURES ~/Media/Pictures
% cd ~/Media/Pictures/Captu*  ## NOTE: update according to your settings
% rename 's/Capture\ d’écran\ d[eu]\ //g;s/\s/-/g' *
```

Don't forget to update the last instruction to reflect basename on your system, use a Makefile or shell script to automate the process. Usually, Ubuntu will create a subfolder ("Screenshots" or "Captures d'écran" or whatever) in the default `PICTURES` folder. What's funny is that instead of a straight single quote, Ubuntu decided for whatever reason to use a curly quote! I used to use the following Bash script on X11, but it no longer works under Wayland:

```shell
scrot '%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S.png' --thumb 300x200 -e 'mv $m $f ~/Media/Pictures/screenshots'
```

<small>Here, <code>screenhots</code> is a soft link to the default subfolder where screenshots are saved.</small><br>

> Common Lisp is a fine language with exceptional interactivity, multiple implementations providing the potential for acceptable performance, useful features like condition system, and a stable standard base. This, in theory, makes is very much suited toward data processing and analysis. Although practice paints a less favorable picture, there are still use cases where Common Lisp could be considered to be a very good pick.
