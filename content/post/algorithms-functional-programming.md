I started reading _Algorithms for Functional Programming_, by John David Stone (Springer, 2018), and it's one of my preferred technical book of this Summer.

The author uses Scheme to illustrate all the concepts discussed in the book. After a brief introduction to functional programming and Scheme (Chapter 1), the author starts discussed more involved concepts. I should note that even if Chapter 1 is an introductory chapter, it features material that you will not find in introductory tutorial on Scheme, like `receive` expressions or advanced let constructs.

A useful recap of Scheme procedures discussed in a chapter is provided at the end of each chapter or in between, with type hinting and a brief description, which is great.
