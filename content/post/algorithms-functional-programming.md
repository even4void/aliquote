I started reading _Algorithms for Functional Programming_, by John David Stone (Springer, 2018), and it's one of my preferred technical book of this Summer. My plan is to finish reading it before the start of the new academic year, and then read [Functional Algorithms, Verified!], then _Purely Functional Data Structures_, by Okasaki, and maybe Bird's _Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design_ in the next few months. Stay tuned!

In this book, the author uses Scheme to illustrate all the concepts discussed in the book. After a brief introduction to functional programming and Scheme (Chapter 1), the author starts discussing more involved concepts. I should note that even if Chapter 1 is an introductory chapter, it features material that you will not find in introductory tutorial on Scheme, like `receive` expressions or advanced `let` constructs.

In each chapter, or even in between sections, a useful recap of Scheme procedures currently discussed is provided, with type hinting and a brief description. I found this very handy as it allows to go back to previous chapter for quick checks.
