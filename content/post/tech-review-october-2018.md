Here is the (not so) monthly tech newsletter for October.

According to Wikipedia, probabilistic programming refers to a programming paradign "designed to describe probabilistic models and then perform inference in those models." I am still on my way to trying [Anglican](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/anglican/language/index.html), but in the meantime, here is the book to read on arXiv: [An Introduction to Probabilistic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10756), written by Jan-Willem van de Meent, Brooks Paige, Hongseok Yang, and Frank Wood. Interestingly, the authors decided to use an abstract language similar in syntax and semantics to Anglican for their illustrations, which is not surprising since Frank Wood designed the Anglican PPL.

[Zip trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06726) have recently been proposed as an efficient replacement for 

What a lovely [interactive population map](https://pudding.cool/2018/10/city_3d/) (h/t [@maartenzam](https://twitter.com/maartenzam/status/1055200741575614465)):

[Principles of Algorithmic Problem Solving](), by Johan Sannemo, 

I just learned about [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io) which enables scalable and reproducible scientific workflows using software containers (actually, [Docker](http://docker.io/) and [Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov/)). What is interesting is that it relies on the idea of Un*x interoperability between processes via pipes (something that we also found in Elixir or R, or even [Python](https://hackernoon.com/adding-a-pipe-operator-to-python-19a3aa295642)). While I have a hard time using pipes when writing R scripts, I can imagine the benefit of 

A new Vega-based implementation of density maps, this time for multiclass problems, is available on Github. The first time I saw it, this reminded me of Hadley Wickham's work on [Embedded Plots](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/embedded-plots.html) (or maybe, [Glyph Maps](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/glyph-maps.html)).

As I always loved 3D moving geometrical objects--and I regularly check plenty of them on Twitter, here is one to end this review:
