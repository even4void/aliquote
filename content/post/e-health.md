Some months ago, I attended a conference that was held at the Cit√© Universitaire in Paris. It was about [e-tools and social networks for epidemiology](http://www.e4n.fr). The program and slides can be found on the website.

The aim of this meeting was to overview current efforts and/or realizations to recruit and involve a maximum number of participants in a given cohort, secure adherence via social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), and collect data in an undemanding way.

Some weeks before, I was also looking for electronic data capture systems, and here is what I found. Most of the systems support [Good Clinical Practice](http://ichgcp.net) for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analyses, and reporting of clinical trials.

- [OpenClinica](https://community.openclinica.com) (Windows or RedHat, or as a web service) provides a community edition which does not include OpenClinica Rules Designer and OpenClinica DataMart but yet offers a [lot of features](https://www.openclinica.com/product-features).
- [Clinic MED](http://sourceforge.net/projects/clinicmed/) is a web-based solution for clinical data management .
- [Open MRS](http://openmrs.org/), not free and not much information on their homepage except there are live demos.
- [REDCap](http://www.project-redcap.org/), from Vanderbilt University, is a PHP/MySQL-based system for web surveys, and it is available in several languages.
- [GNU Health](http://health.gnu.org/) supports electronic medical record and information system more generally. Well, this GNU but I haven't browsed past the homepage.
- [OpenEHR](http://www.openehr.org/) consists in "systems and tools for computing with health information at a semantic level, thus enabling true analytic functions like decision support, and research querying". It looks interesting, although it doesn't seem to provide ready-to-use solutions.
- [OpenEMR](http://www.open-emr.org/) is free and it focus on electronic health records, with clinical decision support and patient management (billing, prescription, etc.)

Regarding simple surveys, REDCap looks like a good alternative to [LimeSurvey](http://www.limesurvey.org/), in my opinion. Since it is free and allows to manage more complex database (biobank, cohort, etc.), I believe this would be my first choice if I had to recommend a flexible on-line management system.
