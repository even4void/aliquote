<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-03-08</a>: Testing my new mapping of the month:

```
nnoremap <expr> <tab> tabpagenr('$') ==? 1 ? "<C-^>" : ":tabnext<cr>"
```

Basically, use TAB to switch to the alternate buffer when there's no other tab, otherwise go to next tab (and cycle). `#vim`<br>

When your search query looks like a filepath, you probably want to use an algorithm designed for filepath matching. This makes zf a “do what I mean” program. --- [A different approach to fuzzy finding](https://nathancraddock.com/blog/2023/a-different-approach-to-fuzzy-finding/)<br>

Be sure to apply the following [patch](https://chalaev.com/emacs) as well. `#vim` `#lisp`<br>

> Deforming programs so they are ‘iterative’ in order that they do not run out of the stack we imagine to be so costly is ridiculous: if you have a program which is inherently recursive, let it be recursive. --- [The absurdity of stacks](https://www.tfeb.org/fragments/2023/03/25/the-absurdity-of-stacks/)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-03-27</a>: The LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) online document browser is really nice. TIL there's even a routine to perform QR factorization without pivoting to a real or complex matrix (related R package: [QR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/QR/index.html)).<br>
