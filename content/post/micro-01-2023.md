> In the beginning, there were blogs, and they were the original social web. We built community. We found our people. We wrote personally. We wrote frequently. We self-policed, and we linked to each other so that newbies could discover new and good blogs. I want to go back there. --- [Bring back personal blogging](https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging) (h/t [Jack Baty](https://baty.net/2023/bring-back-personal-blogging))<br>

> The family therapist Salvador Minuchin declared, "The human experience of identity has two elements: a sense of belonging and a sense of being separate." This is as good a description of digital identity as it is of our psychological identity. A digital identity contains data that uniquely describes a person or thing but also contains information about the subject's relationships to other entities. --- [Defining Digital Identity](https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/01/defining_digital_identity.shtml)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-01-20</a>: As a sequel of this [old post](https://aliquote.org/post/archiving-stackexchange/) of mine, here is the [complete archive](/pub/stackexchange-stats.html) of the 467 answers I provided on Cross Validated during ten years or so. Note that this a raw (unedited) HTML, with many tiny bugs along the way, mostly related to Unicode encoding and missing images from imgur. I can probably with the UTF-8 issue by using a different processor than [htmldoc](https://www.msweet.org/htmldoc/). As for the latter, I believe the issue comes from Pandoc, since I retrieved a larger number of images manually using curl (tarball [archive](/pub/archive_416.tar.gz)).<br>

> In fact, the vast majority of my editing tasks – probably as much as 98% – are performed exactly as if I was in Vim. (For the other 2% I've invented my own Vim-style keybinds.) Normally, I don't notice that I'm actually not in Vim. The fact that I happen to be running the Emacs process is a mere technicality. --- [On Escape Meta Alt Control Shift](https://two-wrongs.com/on-escape-meta-alt-control-shift-emacs.html)<br>
