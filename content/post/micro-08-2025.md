<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-08-02</a>: I just noticed that Neovim now allow for full case-insensitive tab completion in command mode, which means I can now enter path as I do in Zsh. `#vim`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-08-10</a>: [10 new zsh tricks you may not know...](https://leahneukirchen.org/blog/archive/2012/02/10-new-zsh-tricks-you-may-not-know.html).<br>

But Python is prone to having a memory layout that is cache-unfriendly. --- [Python performance myths and fairy tales](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1031707/73cb0cf917307a93/)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-08-13</a>: [Rich’s sh (POSIX shell) tricks](https://www.etalabs.net/sh_tricks.html): lots of little details indeed. `#unix`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-08-13</a>: [journaling system cobbled together with nix, vim, coreutils](https://tangled.sh/@oppi.li/journal). How to make things simple. See also [I Tried Every Todo App and Ended Up With a .txt File](https://www.al3rez.com/todo-txt-journey). `#vim`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-08-14</a>: Apparently, external evaluation cells in Wolfram 14.3 are in trouble with personal `.Renviron` file. If I remove mine, everything goes well, otherwise I get a permission issue with renv. My `$HOME/.Renviron` only modifies the path for renv cache:

```shell
R_LIBS_USER="~/.local/lib/R/library"
R_PROFILE="~/.config/R/Rprofile"
RENV_CONFIG_USER_PROFILE=TRUE
RENV_PATHS_ROOT="~/.cache/org.R-project.R/R/renv"
```

Once R virtual environment is created, I can reinstate my personal config file, and everything is okay, but I guess next time if an R expression that requires to install external dependencies I will face a similar issue. Otherwise, external evaluation cell and the whole `ExternalEvaluate` stuff looks pretty interesting.<br>![img](/img/2025-08-14-13-40-05.png)<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-08-18</a>: TIL about [doxx](https://github.com/bgreenwell/doxx), which is a MS docx viewer for the terminal that preserves formatting and provides an interactive experience.<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-08-19</a>: I got tired of [NNW](/micro/2025-06-12-09-36-20) and I'm back with Newsboat. The [bug](/micro/2025-06-10-09-46-48) I mentioned earlier on was due to a problem with my config file (probably related to multi-threading).<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-08-19</a>: I tried them all (recently, Ghostty, for a day). My preferred terminal emulator was probably foot, back when I was on Linux.

```shell
» ls .config/archived
alacritty/         ghostty/           kitty/             matterbridge.toml  tig/               zed/
foot/              helix/             lazygit/           psql/              wezterm/
```

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-08-19</a>: TIL about [Doppler](https://brushedtype.co/doppler/). Drag'n drop and just press play. `#apple`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-08-19</a>: TIL we can open multiple PDF files as tabs in Preview.app (h/t [Burkhard Schmidt](https://github.molgen.mpg.de/pages/bs/macOSnotes/mac/mac_texpdf_preview.html#how-can-i-enable-tabs-in-preview)). On Sequoia, the corresponding setting is now in the Desktop and Dock panel. `#apple`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-08-20</a>: I recently switched to vi keymap for Zsh. Here are some useful remapping to make it feels smoother:

```shell
bindkey -M vicmd '~' vi-swap-case
bindkey -M vicmd 'u' undo
bindkey -M vicmd 'U' redo
bindkey -M vicmd "?" history-incremental-pattern-search-backward
bindkey -M vicmd "/" history-incremental-pattern-search-forward

bindkey -M viins '^?' backward-delete-char # backspace
bindkey -M viins '^[[Z' reverse-menu-complete # shift-tab
bindkey -M viins '^a' beginning-of-line
bindkey -M viins '^e' end-of-line
bindkey -M viins '^h' backward-delete-char
bindkey -M viins '^k' kill-line
bindkey -M viins '^n' down-history
bindkey -M viins '^p' up-history
bindkey -M viins '^u' backward-kill-line
bindkey -M viins '^w' backward-delete-word
bindkey -M viins '^y' yank

autoload -U edit-command-line
zle -N edit-command-line
bindkey '^f' edit-command-line
```

<small>I don't use `^r` for backward search since it is managed by Fzf directly.</small>And in Tmux:

```shell
bind -T copy-mode-vi u send-keys -X halfpage-up
bind -T copy-mode-vi d send-keys -X halfpage-down
bind -T copy-mode-vi v send-keys -X begin-selection
bind -T copy-mode-vi C-l send-keys -X clear-selection
bind -T copy-mode-vi y send-keys -X copy-selection-and-cancel
bind -T copy-mode-vi 'C-v' send-keys -X rectangle-toggle \; send -X begin-selection
bind -T copy-mode-vi n send-keys -X search-forward "» "
bind -T copy-mode-vi p send-keys -X search-backward "» "
bind -T copy-mode-vi / command-prompt -i -I "#{pane_search_string}" -p "(search down)" { send -X search-forward-incremental '%%%' }
bind -T copy-mode-vi ? command-prompt -i -I "#{pane_search_string}" -p "(search up)" { send -X search-backward-incremental '%%%' }
%if "#{!=:$EDITOR,}"
set editor $EDITOR
bind -T copy-mode-vi C-f send-keys -X pipe-and-cancel 'xargs -I% tmux send-keys $EDITOR Space % Enter'
%endif
```

Which means in both case you can edit a command or a visual selection in your `$EDITOR` using `^f`.<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-08-21</a>: Recently I settled on [glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) and [doxx](https://github.com/bgreenwell/doxx). See also [Terminal Trove](https://terminaltrove.com).<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-08-21</a>: [Mavericks Forever](https://mavericksforever.com). This reminded me that I still have my old [MacBook Pro](/post/os-x-mavericks/) from late 2013, which came with Mavericks pre-installed. I ended up my Apple journey with [Mojave](/post/osx-mojave/) running on a [Macbook 12”](post/setup-2018/), which has always been my preferred version of OSX, and one of the best laptop I used to use over the years. Now the MBP is waiting for Ubuntu to upgrade thousand of packages (I haven't used it for two years now) before I perform a `do-release-upgrade`.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-08-25</a>: Tonight I updated my default colorscheme (`quiet`) in Neovim when I noticed there was a monochrome version. Since we cannot set `t_Co` in Neovim, I create a user colorscheme named `morequiet` using these specs only. I added a few tweaks for diff mode (I like the look'n feel of the `quiet` colors in this case) and TODO-like `@comment.*` identified by Treesitter. So far so good. `#vim`<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-08-27</a>: I don't use Cabal that often, and I manage almost everything with Stack. I accidently installed a package (bhoogle) that adds nothing to Hoogle, but there's no `cabal delete` or `cabal uninstall`, you know. So I simply nuked the whole `$HOME/.cabal` directory that GHCup installed for me with an older version of Cabal. And now I can't get it back. Instead, Cabal now follows the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7386), which means compiled stuff will end up in `$HOME/.local/state`. Let's go for another env variable (`CABAL_DIR`) then. `#haskell`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-08-27</a>: Now playing from Apple Music right into Tmux status line!<br>![img](/img/2025-08-27-09-06-55.png)Put this script somewhere in your `$PATH`:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
unset title

title=$(osascript -e 'if application "Music" is running then' -e 'tell application "Music" to get name of current track' -e 'end if')
artist=$(osascript -e 'if application "Music" is running then' -e 'tell application "Music" to get artist of current track' -e 'end if')

if ${title+"true"}; then echo "$artist ♪ $title"; fi
```

<small>If you don't mind using the `-e` switch as your line separator; otherwise just write a `.scpt` file and load it directly.</small>See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/even4void/b207c1e402fd7787e00e6685f843aee1) for a more elaborated solution that accounts for both Cmus and Apple Music.<br>

I wish people favor builtin stuff more often, as does the author here, rather than installing every single plugin available on GitHub. `#vim`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-08-29</a>: While preparing a short tutorial on using Stack to manage Haskell projects, I noticed that my screenshots include drop shadow from macOS screenshot builtin app. I was reminded that the key is to `⇧⌘4`, then press the Space bar as usual, but before clicking hold down the option (`⌥`) key. `#apple`<br>
