It is usually assumed that the probability of getting the same hash value for two different input items is approximately $\frac{k^2}{2N}$, for $k$ random hash keys ($0 < k < N$) and $N$ possible values.

In essence, it is a lot like the [birthday paradox](/post/paradoxe-anniversaires/) that we discussed earlier.
