Happy birthday to you again...

While I was poking around in my old files, I found this little gem:

I seem to remember this was one of the first time I used Apple Pages other than as a fun activity. I have been editing mostly via (La|Con)TeX since I have been using a computer, and I wrote many many things using a $\TeX$ system before Markdown and Pandoc became first-class citizen for technical or otherwise writings. So, thank you Apple for what you did (even if your last update didn't please many people--but we only criticize what we care about after all)!

The anniversary day went smoothly, btw.
