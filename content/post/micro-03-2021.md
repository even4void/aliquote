<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2021-03-08</a>: I moved out last week, and moved in right away. I just finished unpacking all the boxes. What a journey! I'm exhausted, and I probably need a few weeks to recover. In the meantime, here is the new home office:<br>![office](/img/IMG_1410.JPG)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2021-03-21</a>: Meanwhile, I've been playing with OpenBSD a bit more, and guess what: Kitty terminal emulator is available there too. I'm impressed by the number of packages that are readily available: Kitty, Neomutt and Neovim work right out of the box. I wish Linux (Ubuntu) was using `/usr/local` as the default user directory for local programs, this would simplify config files a lot! `#unix`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2021-03-21</a>: What a week (or two, in fact)! Just starting to feel better right now, after three days at the hospital. I should be ready for the next 8 years, hopefully.<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2021-03-22</a>: > My overall feeling is that if I could spend infinite time and effort, my C programs would be as fast or faster than Rust, because theoretically there's nothing that C can't do that Rust can. But in practice C has fewer abstractions, primitive standard library, dreadful dependency situation, and I just don't have the time to reinvent the wheel, optimally, every time. --- [Speed of Rust vs. C](https://kornel.ski/rust-c-speed)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2021-03-24</a>: > Software engineers have been led to believe that their time is more valuable than CPU time; therefore, wasting CPU cycles in order to reduce development time is always a win. They've forgotten, however, that the application users' time is more valuable than their time. --- [The fallacy of premature optimization](https://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=1513451)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2021-03-25</a>: > The friction of having to write, to structure thoughts in plain text, to remember the name of the person I need to reference on this page: that is the point. Frictionless note-taking produces notes, but it doesn’t - for me - produce memory.<br>> The same goes for a lot of things. I use neovim to edit code like a grandpa, and I don’t use a file tree. There’s no “directory listing” in my editor. I hit ctrl-p and fzf helps me find the file by name. This is obviously not the future of coding: shouldn’t I be navigating the source tree in 3D like in Jurassic Park? Sure, but the names of things, their functionality, and how it all fits together should be things that exist in one’s mind, not just in a computer. --- [The return of fancy tools](https://macwright.com/2021/03/16/return-of-fancy-tools.html)<br>
