Here is the latest bag of tweets<sup>\*</sup>, which covers November 2018.

<!--more-->

(\*) These are interesting news that I found on Twitter and that I archive periodically. Note that I have slightly updated reporting and fetching methods so that you will get between 80 and 120 of my most recent favorites from my Twitter account (`@chlalanne`).

- 2018-11-01 @keegankorthauer: Want to boost power when controlling FDR by using more than just the p-value? We benchmarked several recent FDR methods to evaluate performance, applicability, consistency, and usability in computational biology.
