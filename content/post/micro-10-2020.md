<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2020-10-01</a>: A [minigolf](https://github.com/mgerdes/minigolf) game written without a game engine in C.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2020-10-01</a>: Ah, it looks there's a new thing for editing text on the Mac: [Nova](https://nova.app/). The choice of names for Mac text editors never ceases to amaze me. The last one I heard about from Jan de Leeuw was [Fraise](https://fraise.en.softonic.com/mac), but there were many others at that time (around 2008-2010) and I forgot all about their names.<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2020-10-01</a>: I swear by [vsearch](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch) since a week. It's so fast and handy for all sort of things involving Fast[aq] files.<br>![](/img/2020-09-22-13-31-33.png)<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2020-10-01</a>: I'm halfway thru Season 2 of [Fargo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(TV_series)). Like [True Detective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Detective), each season is independent from the preceding one. I didn't like True Detective S2 (probably because I very much liked S1) so I quit after the first episode. Likewise, I find Fargo S2 far less intriguing than S1. I will probably stop after that one.<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2020-10-03</a>: It's been more than a month now than the interactions I have with my Macbook can be summarized to using Emacs (or Neovim) and Zsh in a Terminal (with 24 bit color enabled) and, optionally (more often than I would like), Firefox or Skim to read PDFs. It's been relaxing, at least. Digital minimalism, plain text mode; I like it.<br>

> Since I became an Apple user back in 1989, I’ve always felt there was more to it than just being a returning customer of a tech company. There was a sense of belonging to a common set of principles that went against the mainstream. That was extremely appealing for someone like me who always moved countercurrent to everything. There were the Mac user groups, places (whether physical or online) to share a passion with like-minded people. There was the idea of ‘thinking differently’ way before it was formalised in 1997 by Apple itself. Apple products weren’t just computers and peripherals, but specialised tools made for people with a creative, think-out-of-the-box mindset. --- [This nine-year chasm](http://morrick.me/archives/9077)<br>

> As a rule, new users, right after introduction to a few basic commands, start indulging in Vim configuration porn. Such porn has various different flavours. There is the “exhibitionist” variety which includes dressing Vim up in status lines, colorschemes, and font decorations in order to impress others. It often leads to Vim being displayed on videos and, nomen omen, “vim-porn” screenshots. There is an “integrated” category where people plug and stretch their Vim until it resembles an IDE. Git integration, autocompletion, language servers, refactoring, and debugging are the tools of trade in this version. And then there are a few more variants, including “fuzzy”, “packaged”, “conveniently re-mapped”, and I am sure anyone could think up some of their own. --- [Porn, Zen, and .vimrc](http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/porn_zen_and_vimrc/)<br>

> The analogy in my mind is that Stata is to the iPhone as R is to Android, as far as social science data analysis goes. I guess SAS would be BlackBerry, insofar as it’s dated and propped up by a strong lock-in among government employees. And SPSS is a Nokia phone that has a slick interface for dialing your friends but requires you to push dozens of extra buttons in a non-intuitive sequence if you want to call anyone new. --- [stata 12!](https://scatter.wordpress.com/2011/06/28/stata-12/)<br>

> Multiplicity comes from the chances (over study repetitions and data looks) you give data to be more extreme (if the null hypothesis holds), not from the chances you give an effect to be real. It is only the latter that is of concern to a Bayesian. Bayesians entertain only one dataset at a time, and if one computes posterior probabilities of efficacy multiple times, it is only the last value calculated that matters. --- [Continuous Learning from Data: No Multiplicities from Computing and Using Bayesian Posterior Probabilities as Often as Desired](https://www.fharrell.com/post/bayes-seq/)<br>
