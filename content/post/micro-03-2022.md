> By carefully examining every album you own, you get to become more familiar with your library, its extent, its variation, and its quirks. People used to spend hours lovingly sorting and resorting their shelves of LPs. In the iTunes age, many of us toss our music into a heap and forget about it. This is great for some people. But there’s value in intimate, complete familiarity with your collection. So instead of a chore, try thinking of correcting tags as quality time with your music collection. That’s what I do. --- [Using the Auto-Tagger](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/tagger.html)<br>

> The two most important ways to make your text easy to read are a short line-length and the copious use of paragraphs.

> My initial reasons for giving up on OS X / macOS were due to my frustrations around developer tooling and package management, problems now largely solved by Homebrew. I got tired of being able to easily do certain kind of development on Linux and then struggle to get all the required pieces set up in the same way on OS X. Then, as soon as Homebrew began to resolve all that, Apple decided to ruin its laptops through the introduction of the awful and annoyingly-loud butterfly keyboard and touchbar. --- [Linux Developer Laptops: Dell's Precision 5500 series reigns supreme](https://wesmckinney.com/blog/linux-laptop-experience/)<br>

> Authors always say the best way to write better is to read more, which I can vouch for in blogging. Building up some RSS feeds in an aggregator like The Old Reader can be a great source of inspiration.<br>> But it’s also important to stress that this is only one approach. 8,000 posts sounds superficially impressive, but doesn’t speak to quality or detail. Writing a few posts a year is just as valid and worthwhile. If you’re having fun doing it, who cares. --- [8,000 post feedback, and regular writing](https://rubenerd.com/8000-post-feedback-and-regular-writing/)<br>

> Random effects/mixed effects models shine for multi-level data such as measurements within cities within counties within states. They can also deal with measurements clustered within subjects. There are at least two contexts for the latter: rapidly repeated measurements where elapsed time is not an issue, and serial measurements spaced out over time for which time trends are more likely to be important. An example of the first is a series of tests on a subject over minutes when the subject does not fatigue. An example of the second is a typical longitudinal clinical trial where patient responses are assessed weekly or monthly. For the first setup, random effects are likely to capture the important elements of within-subject correlation. Not so much for the second setup, where serial correlation dominates and time ordering is essential. --- [Longitudinal Data: Think Serial Correlation First, Random Effects Second](https://www.fharrell.com/post/re/)<br>

> [I]n biology, when one research team publishes something useful, then other labs want to use it too. Important work in biology gets replicatedall the time—not because people want to prove it’s right, not because people want to shoot it down, not as part of a “replication study,” but just because they want to use the method. So if there’s somethingthat everybody’s talking about, and it doesn’t replicate, word will get out. --- [Biology as a cumulative science, and the relevance of this idea to replication](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/03/04/biology-as-a-cumulative-science-and-the-relevance-of-this-idea-to-replication/)<br>

> Some developers won’t use an editor without a debugger, or linting, or Git built-in. For me, these aren’t hard requirements but are bonuses. Indeed, most good editors have these, or plugins that enable them.
