Out of curiosity, I tried [Regolith Desktop] yesterday. I was looking at Pop OS for a long time before deciding on [i3] last year, mostly because Gnome shell and Gnome WM eat up too much memory to my taste, and because I was looking for a keyboard centric experience to manage and navigate my desktop environment. I must say that Regolith Desktop rocks!

Regolith Desktop is originally based on [i3-gaps], but it adds further keyboard centric and TUIs specific to i3. Above all, it comes with sensible default settings and its installation is a breeze. Just issue `sudo add-apt-repository pa:megalith-Linux/release && budo apt install megalith-desktop-standard` in your terminal and you're done.
