> One of the guiding lights of the UNIX utilities or software tools has been the deeply-felt conviction that text should be stored in as simple, as general a format as possible so that any program can easily process it. This idea (it seems to have been present from the beginning) has had the widest impact possible on UNIX in all its varieties. However, there has been a regrettable tendency to move away from it in recent times, especially among commercial software developers. --- [UNIX Evolution: 1975-1984](http://www.collyer.net/who/geoff/history.html)<br>

> The point is, there’s no reason why this bug — and it is a bug! — should have stuck around for so long. If your terminal emulator gets told to make text blue, and instead it makes it unreadable, then you can’t say that’s not a problem with the terminal emulator. --- [That Annoying Shade of Blue](https://bsago.me/posts/that-annoying-shade-of-blue)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-09-12</a>: A slightly updated version of all my emails as discussed in a [post](/post/statistics-mu4e/) in 2014. Note that I've reduced my mailbox to 20% of its original size since I wrote the blog post, and I keep archiving very few new messages. Also I resubscribed to a bunch of mailing-lists in 2022, which I keep in separate Maildirs but they are included in this chart. I'm still a happy user of [mu](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/).<br>![img](/img/allmyemails.png)Updated code (because `mu-find` now uses the system locale to format dates):

```shell
$ export LC_ALL=C
$ mu find --sortfield=date --fields="d" date:17y..1d | \awk -F " " '{print  $5 "-" $2}' | \uniq -c | awk '{print $2 " " $1}' > 1.dat
```

<br>
```r
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(zoo)
Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL","C")
d <- read.table("1.dat", header = FALSE)
d$V1 <- paste(d$V1, "15", sep = "-")
d$V1 <- as.Date(as.POSIXct(d$V1, format = "%Y-%b-%d", tz = "GMT"))
names(d) <- c("Time", "Emails")
p <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = Time, y = Emails)) +
  geom_line(color=grey(.5)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=rollmean(Emails, 12, na.pad=TRUE)), linewidth = 1.5) +
  scale_x_date(breaks = "1 year", minor_breaks = "2 months",labels = date_format("%Y")) +
  xlab("") +
  theme_bw()
ggsave("allmyemails.png", p, width = 12, height = 5)

> In the end, the main thought here is the following: build using simple proven techniques even if you’re using a technology like Haskell. For anything extra (like dependent types, formal verification, etc.) you might want to think twice and thrice.

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-09-18</a>: It appears that Neomutt can be quite slow when filtering/searching emails using body keyword or patterns and the "limit" (`l`) command. It seems that Neomutt needs to open all emails beforehand, which makes sense but slow down any search operation. Now, as suggested in [#3273](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/3273), we can speed up things a lot by disabling the `auto_view text/html` feature. My benchmarks confirm those of the poster, with around 13K messages in my Archives. I don't know how to disable auto_view temporarily, but since I can use `mu-find` to search my email database, with almost the same syntax, I do'nt have to worry much: results are almost instantaneous!

```
macro index \Cf "<shell-escape>mutt-mu " "mu find"
macro index gf  "<change-folder-readonly>~/.mu/results<enter>" "mu find results"
```

<small>Here, `mutt-mu` is a short shell script for `mu find --clearlinks --format=links --linksdir=~/.mu/results "$1"`.</small><br>

The train would be my 90mph office with scenery for those four hours in each direction, and I’d get to enjoy lunch somewhere new.

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-09-20</a>: Trying out [texlab](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab) since yesterday. So far it has been working smoothly alongside vimtex and null-ls (to format bibtex files). Last year I played with [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/index.html), which looks great, especially if you don't want to manage a full installation of the $\TeX$ system. [Both](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab/wiki/Tectonic) seem to play well together. `#vim` `#tex`<br>

This should be available in more [recent versions](https://askubuntu.com/q/161851) of `notify-send` (Ubuntu ≥ 22.10).

```
set new_mail_command="notify-send.sh --replace-file=/tmp/muttnotification -a neomutt -u low -i neomutt 'New Email' '%n new messages, %u unread.' &"
```

Beforehand I tried [notify-send.py](https://github.com/phuhl/notify-send.py) which didn't quite work.<br>

> It was the precursor of what was later known as the Gifi System, which is a large reorganization of descriptive multivariate analysis techniques in such a way that they apply both to numerical and non-numerical data. That covers regression and principal components analysis, factor analysis, all those techniques in one common framework and ultimately in a series of computer programs as well. My dissertation was basically the first programmatic statement of that program. The Gifi project itself ran until about 1990, I left in 1987, but there was still some ends to wrap up and the Data Theory group in Leiden that still existed at the time, wrapped up those loose ends. They produced a book, the final version of the Gifi book. --- [Interview of Jan de Leeuw by Lisa Wijsen](https://jansweb.netlify.app/post/wijsen/)
