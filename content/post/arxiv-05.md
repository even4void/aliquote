Here are some papers that I read this week, in the CS and Stat category, plus random stuff that were mentioned on IRC or Hacker News.

### Scalable Econometrics on Big Data -- The Logistic Regression on Spark (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10341)

I managed to try some Spark and H20 examples a long time ago, but this was really for toy study. I'm usually happy with R or Stata for statistical modeling. However, this article brings interesting insights into large scale data processing using Spark, together with an empirical study of Python+Spark ML versus R in the case of logistic regression. Apparently, the new Spark ML library exposes two different versions of the logistic regression, one direct method (`ml.classification.LogisticRegression`) and the general linear model approach (`ml.regression.GeneralizedLinearRegression`).
