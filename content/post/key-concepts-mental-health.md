I was just reading Key Concepts in Mental Health, Second Edition, 2009 David Pilgrim (University of Central Lancashire) [SAGE Publications Ltd](http://www.sagepub.com/booksProdDesc.nav?prodId=Book233937), 216 pp., ISBN: 9781848608801.

Surely a good introductory book for those interested in Mental health research and applications. It is written in a clear and concise way, with a short list of academic references for each section. The discussion surrounding concepts associated with mental illness and well-being target a professional audience. However, the discussion evolves around sociological, psychological, and psychiatric considerations.

The textbook is organized in three parts and I must admit that I was mainly interested by the first one which summarizes main concepts in MH.
