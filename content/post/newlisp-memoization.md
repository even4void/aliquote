Surely, the Fibonacci recursive algorithm that is presented everywhere serves no purpose other than introducing the recursive way of thinking,[^1] but anyway I'm here at writing another snippet of Lisp code to compute Fibonacci numbers. The real problem with those algorithms is that we are going to compute the same value over and over again. One solution is to rely on memoization, and in a [previous post] I discussed how to do so in Racket.

Using typed Racket, I wrote:

```racket
(: fib (-> Integer Integer))
(define fib (memoize (lambda ([n : Integer])
                        (if (<= n 2) 1
                            (+ (fib (- n 1))
                               (fib (- n 2)))))))
```

Now, it appears that newLISP, which I'm playing with for the Summer, also comes with a [memoization macro]:

```lisp
(define-macro (memoize mem-func func)
    (set (sym mem-func mem-func)
        (letex (f func  c mem-func)
          (lambda ()
              (or (context c (string (args)))
              (context c (string (args)) (apply f (args))))))))

(define (fibo n)
    (if (< n 2)  1
        (+  (fibo (- n 1))
            (fibo (- n 2)))))

(memoize fibo-m fibo)
```
