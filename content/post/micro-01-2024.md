<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-01-11</a>: A simplified boxplot, with (much) fewer Stata commands than the one proposed in this [old post](/post/stata-plot-02/):

```stata
sysuse auto
graph box mpg,  over(foreign) box(1, color(white)) ///
  medtype(marker) medmarker(mcolor(black) mlwidth(0)) ///
  cwhiskers alsize(0) lines(lpattern(solid) lwidth(medium)) ///
  ylabel(, nogrid) yscale(noline) ///
  title("{bf}Box Plot", pos(11) size(2.75)) ///
  subtitle("City Mileage over number of cylinders", pos(11) size(2))
graph export /home/chl/tmp/better-bxp.eps
```

Net is no longer something additional to your daily tasks, it is essential for your daily tasks. --- [We've become overdependent on the net](https://andreyor.st/posts/2023-12-26-weve-become-overdependent-on-the-net/)<br>

> What strikes me about my personal experience with LLMs is that I have learned precisely when to use them and when their use would only slow me down. I have also learned that LLMs are a bit like Wikipedia and all the video courses scattered on YouTube: they help those with the will, ability, and discipline, but they are of marginal benefit to those who have fallen behind. I fear that at least initially, they will only benefit those who already have an advantage. --- [LLMs and Programming in the first days of 2024](http://antirez.com/news/140)<br>

> This difficulty is often not due to math - because of the aforementioned frameworks machine learning implementations do not require intense mathematics. An aspect of this difficulty involves building an intuition for what tool should be leveraged to solve a problem. This requires being aware of available algorithms and models and the trade-offs and constraints of each one. --- [Why is machine learning 'hard'?](https://ai.stanford.edu/~zayd/why-is-machine-learning-hard.html)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-01-24</a>: I recently switch from MC 1.19.4 with Forge and Optifine to MC 1.20.4 with Iris and Sodium. Now I got a lot more mods available with less frictions overall. And it looks like we can now play MC on a laptop with texture packs and shaders all time long.It's probably time to stop building on 1.19.4 I guess, and just start a new survival journey.<br>![img](/img/2024-01-07_16.04.39.png)<br>
