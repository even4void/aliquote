> Additional resistance towards plugins seems to be some kind of purist animosity against straying away from some core set of Vim functionality. But if you’re using Vim, you’re already in a subset of people who demand that editing text be fast and efficient, so it’s like a group of savants arguing about which is the most eccentric. The set of people that use a movement plugin like EasyMotion or vim-sneak will argue that they’re more efficient than vanilla Vim users, and vanilla Vim users will argue that they’re more efficient than non-Vim users, and so on. The argument will be moot when we can control computers with our brains anyway. --- [Vim after 15 years](https://statico.github.io/vim3.html)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2020-07-03</a>: I'm trying [coc](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) with Neovim. So far it looks great. Now, I learned that there's a ["native" plugin](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lsp) for LSP in neovim. `#vim`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2020-07-03</a>: Ok, so I just tried out [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/). While this looks like a great WM, unfortunately it does not really support i3 [stacking and tabbing](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_changing_the_container_layout) features --- at least [for the moment](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/203) (see also this more [recent update](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/337)), which (I believe) would be the most interesting options for small Retina displays. Update: I reinstalled the HEAD version and tried the "stack" layout, which looks like a simple fullscreen display, not really stacking à la i3wm.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2020-07-03</a>: This is so f$*ing crazy that I would just love testing it for 5' on my Macbook: [yabai macOS Tiling Window Manager Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdwhjIg_Xe4) (Youtube). Still, I strongly believe that tiling WM are great for larger displays than a 12" one. Well, it's still tempting, if only to solve the problems inherent in Spaces and floating windows.<br>

> But there is one language that seems to inspire a peculiar universal reverence: Lisp. Keyboard crusaders that would otherwise pounce on anyone daring to suggest that some language is better than any other will concede that Lisp is on another level. Lisp transcends the utilitarian criteria used to judge other languages, because the median programmer has never used Lisp to build anything practical and probably never will, yet the reverence for Lisp runs so deep that Lisp is often ascribed mystical properties. --- [How Lisp Became God's Own Programming Language](https://twobithistory.org/2018/10/14/lisp.html)<br>

> The problem arises from logistic regression often being taught as a “classification” algorithm in the machine learning world. I was personally not taught this way– I learned from econometricians that you can use either probit or “logit” as general linear models in the event you want to estimate on a binary target variable, and that these models calculate probabilities. Thinking about logistic regression as a probability model easily translates to the classification case, but the reverse simply does not seem to be true. --- [Why Do So Many Practicing Data Scientists Not Understand Logistic Regression?](https://ryxcommar.com/2020/06/27/why-do-so-many-practicing-data-scientists-not-understand-logistic-regression/)<br>
