A whole month without writing anything. What a salutary change of scenery after all! I must say I was getting a bit fed up with the computer and I really needed some holiday away from it all. Done. Back to the blog, whatever that means these days.

I have a draft which dates back from mid July, and a long list of bookmarks which are awaiting for my review. Other than that, nothing's really new. I took some days off, played Minecraft for many long hours, helped a friend of mine renovating his flat, done a lot of tidying up and renovating in my own flat, and here we are.

I watched a lot of not-so-great TV series recently, but I dicovered a nice internet radio (ABC Lounge). I also have a long list of books from the _Actes Sud_ collection to read or reread, but see below. I haven't read a lot this year, which is somewhat surprising since I'm used to read almost 100 books a year.

As can be seen in the above picture (right), the gaming station for my son is ready as well.
