I just finished watching [Sense8] (Seasons 1 and 2). It is a great TV show that I highly recommend. I'm now looking for the next serie that will be as entertaining as this one. For the moment, I'm watching [3%].

I'm fiddling with Lisp and Scheme when I have some free time. Of course, I'm using Neovim for editing Lisp code and I yet have to write a blog post about that, but I don't miss Emacs. Trust me, Neovim is quite a decent editor for Lisp code by any standards. Meanwhile, I'm reading or re-reading some good books on Lisp, and even flame wars on Hacker News from time to time. My idea remains the same: doing everything I used to perform in R or Stata with Lisp or Scheme. This may eventually take a decade or two, most probably.

I'm on vacation for the whole month of July but I need to rest. I don't waste my time though since I spend a good part of my days [traveling] or cooking. Some ideas of appetizers below:

I also managed to get back to reading books more regularly than at the beginning of the year. I still don't read enough in my opinion but I'm trying to correct that so that I can have decent statistics by the end of the year. One of my recent discoveries amazed me for a few days (I always need more time to absorb poetry than novels or essays):

I also have some books to review in some future posts, including _Successful Lisp_, _Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming_, or _Quickstart Molecular Biology_. And a long list of TODOs to cleanup at some point...
