I recently reread Kaplan's proposal to teach statistics to future statisticians, and if we trust the following two papers published in 2017, we should have a solid plan for teaching Data Science, or what it will be called in some years.

1. Donoho, D. (2017). [50 years of data science](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10618600.2017.1384734). *Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics*, 26(4), 745–766.

    I am a bit late at reviewing this article, and it has been largely debated on Twitter in the past months. However, I feel like it is interesting to discuss this article first as it brings some context and appetizer for understanding Kaplan's plan.

    I like the fact that Donoho references former publications by John Tukey, who is often forgotten from beyond exploratory data analysis, but I was surprised to learn that the term "data science" was originally coined by William S. Cleveland no later than 2001 and by Jeff Wu in 1997. According to Jeff Wu in his 1997 [presentation on Data Science](http://www.isye.gatech.edu/∼jeffwu/Presentations/datascience.pdf) (PDF), statistical education should be more thoughly balanced between theoretical and applied statistics and other scientific fields, with a particular emphasis on large data (it is not yet called the big data era), bayesian priors, and computational algorithms. That all sounds good to me, but see how the second article below emphasizes those latter points.

    As a sidenote, Norman Matloff in [his own review](https://matloff.wordpress.com/2016/01/23/some-comments-on-donahos-50-years-of-data-science/) made an interesting point:

    > One topic I was surprised to see the essay omit was the fact that so much data today is not in the nice "rectangular" — observations in rows, variables in equal numbers of columns — form that most methodology assumes. 

    Indeed, it is time to realize that we can't think of large data, or even data at large, as well structured tabular entities like is the case of data frame. Paul Murrell discussed with particular care the variety of data sources, including XML and text input, in his book [Introduction to Data Technologies](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/ItDT/).
