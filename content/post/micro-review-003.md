- [Patch Workflow With Mutt - 2019](http://kroah.com/log/blog/2019/08/14/patch-workflow-with-mutt-2019/). Even if I am not using mutt for reading/writing emails, I always find interesting others' appraoch to email processing.

- [Thoughts on Racket2](https://beautifulracket.com/appendix/thoughts-on-racket2.html). A few weeks ago I mentioned the hot news from the latest Racket conf, namely the fact that the next-gen Racket (aka Racket2?) will probably be parenthesis-free. Matthew Butterick has a much more detailed overview of the points raised by Matthew Flatt, and he has some very on the point thoughts on the future of Lisp languages.

> In the case of Lisp languages like Racket, Matthew Flatt is right: among a certain audience of potential users, parentheses are a deterrent. Who knows why? But in the last 60 years, simply grabbing these dissenters by the lapels and fumigating them with the stinky garlic breath of parenthesized S-expressions has not been a winning strategy. If Lisp partisans want different results in the next 60 years, we need to try something new.
