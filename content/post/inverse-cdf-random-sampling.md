There are many ways to generate random samples from a given distribution, including Monte Carlo simulation. In this case, the random number generation process consists in generating i.i.d. uniform $\mathcal{U}(0,1)$ RVs, convert them to independent $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ RVs, and eventually convert them to correlated $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ RVs. Once we get uniform random variables on $(0,1)$, we can use one of the following methods to convert them to gaussian RVs: the Box-Muller or the Marsaglia polar method, or the inverse CDF transformation.

I already talked about the Box-Muller approach in the past, although I can't find related posts or notes on this site, but the idea is as follows: You generate two independent $\mathcal{U}(0,1)$ RVs on $(0,1)$ and then you define two new independent $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ RVs, $x_1$ and $x_2$, using this transformation:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
x_1 &= \sqrt{-2\log(y_1)} \text{cos}(2\pi y_2)\cr
x_2 &= \sqrt{-2\log(y_1)} \text{sin}(2\pi y_2).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

To get ride of the trigonometric functions, the Marsaglia's polar method instead considers two independent $\mathcal{U}(0,1)$ RVs on $(-1,1)$ and accept them is $r^2 = y_1^2 + y_2^2 < 1$.[^1] Once accepted, generate $x_1$ and $x_2$ as follows:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
x_1 &= \sqrt{-2\log(r^2)/r^2} y_1\cr
x_2 &= \sqrt{-2\log(r^2)/r^2} y_2.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

Finally, the inverse CDF transformation is a little more involved. Recall that a standard gaussian variate $Z$, with mean 0 and variance 1 has the following probability density function (PDF):

$$ \phi(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}z^2\right). $$

Its cumulative distribution function (CDF) is then $\Phi(z) = \Pr(Z<z) = \int_{-\infty}^z\phi(s)ds$. The inverse CDF method is used to compute $x = \Phi^{-1}(y)$, with $y$ distributed uniformly on $(0,1)$.

Note that the normal CDF $\Phi(x)$ is related to the error function $\text{erf}(x)$, as discussed on [Wikipedia]. Indeed, $\Phi(x) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\text{erf}(x/\sqrt{2})$, which implies:

$$ \Phi^{-1}(y) = \sqrt{2}\text{erf}^{-1}(2y-1). $$
