Meantime, London IPA, 7.4%. Alan Walker, Spectre (NCS Release).

It's been a while since the last entry in the [Unquantified](/post/unquantified-self-017/) series. Not so many things happen, except that I came back to work early September. I've been listening to a lot of tracks recently, thanks to my new [laptop setup](/post/music-setup/), and reading some books, some of which I enjoyed a lot.

I came home yesterday after visiting my aunt. Nice weather, great lunch's and dinners during a few days.

Nothing more, nothing less.
