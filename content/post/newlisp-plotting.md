I installed newlisp manually, although I now realize there's a deb package available for Ubuntu 22.04. Anyway, I was missing two files: `guiserver.lsp` and `guiserver.jar`. The Lisp file is easy to get from the [modules](http://www.newlisp.org/modules/) page, and I just copied it to the right place (`/usr/local/share/newlisp`) but I found no indication on how to get the Java file. So I grabbed a copy of `guiserver.jar` from the guiserver.tgz tarball referenced on [Links and Code Contributions](http://www.newlisp.org/index.cgi?Code_Contributions), and it just works. Note that I also had to install `libcanberra-gtk-module` along the way, in order to remove a minor warning when issuing plotting commands.

The statitstics module only contains very basic stuff, but there's also a gsl module which gives us more power. Unfortunately, it expects GSL library in `/usr/local/lib`, and not `/usr/lib`. I symlinked `libgslcblas.so` and `libgsl.so` into `/usr/local/lib`, and this solved the problem.

Let's get [some data](/pub/birthwt.csv):[^1]

```lisp
(load (append (env "NEWLISPDIR") "/modules/plot.lsp"))
(set 'data (read-file "birthwt.csv"))
(replace "," data " " 0)
(set 'values (map int (parse data)))
(set 'x (rest (select values (sequence 2 (length values) 10))))
(set 'y (rest (select values (sequence 9 (- (length values) 1) 10))))
```

The `x` and `y` variable defined above represent the weight of the mother and of the baby, respectively. There might be a better way to mine those values from the tabular dataset, but contrary to xlispstat, newlisp isn't really a col-major language. Anyway, we are ready to generate a basic scatterplot:

```lisp
(set 'plot:title "Birthweight dataset")
(set 'plot:sub-title "Hosmer & Lemeshow, Wiley 2000 (2nd ed.)")
(set 'plot:unit-x "Mother weight (lbs)")
(set 'plot:unit-y "Baby weight (g)")
(plot:XY x y)
(plot:export "fig-bwt-newlisp.png")
```

{{< figure src="/img/fig-bwt-newlisp.png" >}}

That was quite easy, but I fear there's not much plotting functions available except `plot`, which produces univariate line plot. I guess we will have to resort to Gnuplot or plotutils for more capabilities. However, let that not stop us investigate into this scripting language. In future posts, I expect to show how to fit basic linear models using GSL and to perform some data mining tasks.
