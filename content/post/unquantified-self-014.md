August was pretty cool as I spent most of my time with my son. We even had a little trip to Bordeaux. But TBH we remain most of the time at home, playing (him) and reading (me). I also had a long strike editing my dot files (Emacs, Vim, Zsh, Fzf, Rg), which ended up a few days ago with me installing Amethyst and Firefox, hence leaving macOS native apps altogether. I mist say that I'm pretty happy with my new setup: this is mostly TUI, except for Firefox and some occasional interactions with Transmit or CleaMyMac apps. This remind me of my old days with OS X, when I was compiling all my applications as 64 bits exec (no Fink or Homebrew at this time), and even before when I only had Linux available on my laptop. I'm staling my Macbook: This will be Mojave, Doom Emacs (from July 2020 --- I'm tired of updatig and fixing the little glitches here and there after each upgrade), and some occasional updates on things I mostly care about (LLVM, Lisp, Scheme).

I'm back to work after a month off. It hurts, really, since I spent the last 5 months at home, without interaction with the outside world, but that's life. No recommendations were given for people with chronic disease this time: the show must go on and I assume we have to support the economy somehow. I doubt the academic world would contribute anything in this regard, but let's see.
