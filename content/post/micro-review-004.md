Here is the monthly micro review of (not so) random links I found while browsing the interweb lately.

Here we are, finally:

I've heard a bit of Catalina during the beta, but not so much. It's probably because I mostly turn away from Twitter lately. Now that I reviewed the new features and checked what's working (yeah, apparently [notifications work great](https://tyler.io/macos-10-15-vista/)!) and what's not, I will put on hold the upgrade. My current config looks ok to me and I clearly don't see any added value to the upcoming macOS version: I already have an iPhone, and I don't need an iPad. This just led me to think that I could probably turn back to Linux, using some kind of a minimalist desktop (e.g., [i3](https://i3wm.org)) running on a [Matebook](https://consumer.huawei.com/us/tablets/matebook-x-pro/). So now you know what my dream setup would be if things get too [broken](https://tyler.io/broken/) on macOS or my Macbook were suddenly to crash.

> We haven't seen a ton of machine improvement in the past decade so I aim for reliable workhorses a ways down the cost-depreciation curve.

Unlike [Graydon Hoare](https://usesthis.com/interviews/graydon.hoare/), I think there still is a place for nice laptops on the market. Problem is that Macbook are getting too expensive (at least for me, now that I have to buy then again myself), so if the software get broken there's no point in keeping fighting again and again.

I'm done with the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com), which I completed quickly Wednesday morning. If I have read the rules before, I would have chosen otehr repository, surely, or I would have worked on my GH solely. Anyway, if I get a T-shirt, it will go to my preferred Fortnite and Minecraft player (you already guessed who's the guy, right?).

If you like math and CS, here are a bunch of textbooks available online or in PDF format that I came across recently:

- [Algebra, Topology, Differential Calculus, and Optimization Theory For Computer Science and Machine Learning](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jean/math-deep.pdf), by Jean Gallier and Jocelyn Quaintance;
- [Linear Algebra and Applications: An Inquiry-Based Approach](https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&context=books), by Feryal Alayont and Steven Schlicker;
- [Bayesina inference with INLA](https://becarioprecario.bitbucket.io/inla-gitbook/), by Virgilio Gómez-Rubio. Note that Aki Vehtari also made his [BDA course](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto) available for free on Github.

[Solving a Danish Defense Intelligence Puzzle](https://safiire.github.io/blog/2017/08/19/solving-danish-defense-intelligence-puzzle/): I like discovering new content or long standing blogs that I just learned about via some other blog posts. In this case, this post is far beyond my technical knowledge but I found it interesting anyway and I learned a bit of reverse engineering.

I am quite happy with my Micro blog since I don not use any extra package and just use basic Hugo facilities to run the two blog simultaneously. It could be better, of course, but that's okay as far as I am concerned. I am aware of other micro-blogging platforms or APIs, but I just learned about [Microblog](https://microblog.pub) (h/t [Jan-Lukas Else](https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/10/microblogpub/)).

Brett Terpstra has a nice post regarding the Fish shell on his blog: [Branching out from Bash: Fishing expedition](https://brettterpstra.com/2019/10/11/branching-out-from-bash-fishing-expedition/). This was especially useful since I [switched to Fish](/post/fish-shell/) recently myself. I learned quite a bit from reading his blog post and looking at [his code](https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/bcbba84438257e1d182480d3d929047a) available on Github.

_Blog rolling_:

- [Computational survivalist](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheEndeavour/~3/FlB6bwZIEcA/). The last point is very well put:

  > I’m more sympathetic to minimalism than survivalism. You can be more productive by learning to use a small set of tools well than by hacking away with a large set of tools you hardly know how to use.

- [Combining automatically factor levels with trees](https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/58446). It's getting rarer that I read posts on R, the language. However, from time to time I came across some posts I used to like, you know, those posts where you get both the code and some pretty figures around.

- [Handy FFMpeg Automator Scripts](http://brendandawes.com/blog/handy-ffmpeg-automator-scripts). It's been a while since I haven't used `ffmpeg`. last time was probably for a talk where I needed to assemble some pieces of ggplot into a movie.

- [Old bugs never die or fade away](https://leancrew.com/all-this/2019/10/old-bugs-never-die-or-fade-away/). The take away message is probably to be careful with what you put in your init files.
