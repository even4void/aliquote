<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-03-04</a>: A new version of Racket (8.16) has just been released. There's now full support for Student t distribution. Easy upgrade (pending a minor issue with Homebrew installed libzmq):

```shell
brew upgrade
raco pkg migrate 8.15
rm -rf ~/Library/Racket/8.15
cp /opt/homebrew/Cellar/zeromq/4.3.5_1/lib/libzmq.5.dylib ~/Library/Racket/8.16/lib
raco iracket install
```

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-03-10</a>: I just spent half an hour decluterring my `\$HOME` dotfiles and movinf everything I could to standard XDG config, data and state directories. Looks much cleaner now.

```shell
~
.CFUserTextEncoding  .cargo/              .local/              .ssh/                Library/             backup/
.DS_Store            .config/             .mail/               .stack/              Movies/              cwd/
.Renviron            .ctags               .npm/                .zprofile            Music/               tmp/
.Trash/              .cups/               .nvm/                Desktop/             Pictures/
.cabal/              .deno/               .roswell/            Documents/           Public/
.cache/              .ghcup/              .rustup/             Downloads/           Sites/
```

The cornerstone for running zsh properly is to point `ZDOTDIR` to the relevant XDG data directory.

```shell
ZDOTDIR=$HOME/.config/zsh
for file in $HOME/.config/profile.d/*.sh; do
  . "$file"
done
```
