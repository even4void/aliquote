Consider the problem where there's no direct solution to $Xb = y$, yet we may be looking for the best approximation of $y$ as a linear combination of the columns of $X$. One of the well-known application of this setting is the linear regression model, of course. Recall that the OLS solution is $\left(X^TX\right)^{-1}X^Ty$.

Rather than inverting the $X$ matrix, we will use QR decomposition, as R does, since we assume a full (column) rank matrix $X$. The QR decomposition reads $X=\underset{m\times n}{Q}\overset{n\times n}{R}$, where $Q^TQ=I_n$ (columns are orthonormal) and $R$ is an upper-triangular invertible matrix. Note that

$$ \left(X^TX\right)^{-1}X^Ty = \left(R^TQ^TQR\right)^{-1}R^TQ^Ty = \left(R^TR\right)^{-1}R^TQ^Ty = R^{-1}Q^Ty. $$

In the end, we only really need to solve $Rx = \bar y$, where $y$ is rotated as $\bar y = Q^Ty$, using backward substitution.

More information can be found in this [on-line course](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee127/sp21/livebook/l_ols_ls_def.html) and this longer artcile on the Stan website: [The QR Decomposition For Regression Models](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/qr_regression.html). For a more detailed treatment, I would suggest [Numerical Methods of Statistics](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~monahan/nmos2/toc.html) (2nd ed.), by John F. Monahan, especially for the connection with Householder transformations (ยง5.6.).

Let's implement this approach in Lisp using the [magicl](https://github.com/quil-lang/magicl) package, which provides low-level bindings to BLAS/LAPACK as well as a high-level interface with everything we need for common linear algebra problems (e.g., SVD, Cholesky or QR decomposition, etc.). Other CL libraries are available but I like this one because it is actively maintained by working heroes, including Robert Smith (@stylewarning), who also happens to play piano. We also need a toy artificial dataset.

```lisp
(ql:quickload :magicl)
(setf *read-default-float-format* 'double-float)
(defparameter *X* (magicl:from-list '(3.0 2.0  2.0
                                      2.0 3.0 -2.0)
                                    '(2 3)))
```

The instruction `(magicl:qr *X*)` should return the two matrices $Q$ and $R$. We can use built-in facilities to compute $\bar y$, but solving $Rx = \bar y$ requires a back substitution procedure.
