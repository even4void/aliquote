Lately I have been playing with Python and the [ETE toolkit](http://etetoolkit.org) to build and compare phylogenetic trees. As discussed in a [recent post](/post/comparing-trees), phylogenetic trees are used to unravel the evolutionary relationships or lineage between a set of genetic sequences. The ETE toolkit has a long history now,[^1] and it is definitely the way to go if you are diving into phylogenetic analysis in Python. It is both a module that you can import the usual way in a Python console, and a set of executable workflows that you run from your preferred shell.
