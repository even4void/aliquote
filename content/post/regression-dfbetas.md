In a previous post, we discussed how influence measures can provide some insights on data quality or model fit. There are various [cutoff values](https://www.sfu.ca/sasdoc/sashtml/stat/chap55/sect38.htm) that are used to interpret each of these quantities, e.g., $\text{Cook's d} > 4/(n-k-1)$, $\text{DFFITS} > 2\sqrt{p/n}$, $\text{DFBETAS} > 2/\sqrt{n}$. The latter emphasizes regression coefficients themselves.
