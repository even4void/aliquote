<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-02</a>: Cleaning up some old stuff on my HD and just found this [nice Beamer template](https://github.com/Witiko/fibeamer): Mypreferred one is the ["fi" variant](https://github.com/Witiko/fibeamer/blob/master/test/mu/expected-fi-lualatex.pdf). `#latex`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-02</a>: [Tropical geometry of statistical models](https://www.pnas.org/content/101/46/16132.abstract). At least, the conclusion is veryunderstandable:> The algebraic representation for graphical models with hidden variables leads> naturally to an interpretation of a parameterized model as a point on an> algebraic variety. Marginal probabilities are coordinates of points on the> variety. Varieties can be tropicalized, and the statistical meaning is that the> MAP prob- abilities (calculated with logarithms of the parameters) can be> interpreted as coordinates of points on the positive part of the tropical> variety.<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-03</a>: After [Tamás K. Papp's CL libraries](https://tpapp.github.io/post/orphaned-lisp-libraries/), I discovered this new library for numericalcomputing in the Lisp world: [MAGICL](https://github.com/rigetti/magicl). `#lisp`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-03</a>: Home alone again...{{< figure src="/img/IMG_0521.jpg" >}}<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-03</a>: Just doing my little technical care and weekly backup. [Homebrew 2 is out](https://brew.sh/2019/02/02/homebrew-2.0.0/).`text~  brew --versionHomebrew 2.0.0Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision 175af; last commit 2019-02-02)Homebrew/homebrew-cask (git revision 05a81; last commit 2019-02-02)`{{< figure src="/img/2019-02-03-20-21-00.png" >}}<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-04</a>: Just throw out more than 30k messages from my Gmail account. I have a localcopy, so no worries, but the Google team will have a harder time to analyze it.Incidentally, I just came across a [new testimony](https://defn.io/2019/02/04/bye-bye-google/) from people tired of Google.Last round shown below:{{< figure src="/img/2019-02-04-20-00-09.png" >}}BTW, did you know that Google actually stores everything you buy based onpayment or shipping receipts?<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-04</a>: Updating my global dist for the newly released v1.1 of [Julia](https://julialang.org). Installingpackages is much easier (e.g. [Gadfly](http://gadflyjl.org)) and smoother compared to the precedingversions (prior to v1). Only caveat is that rendering plot via Gadfly is kind ofslow, especially compared to other graphing engines (R, Gnuplot, Mathematica, oreven Stata). `#julia`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-04</a>: [Magithub](https://github.com/vermiculus/magithub/) (soon, [forge](https://github.com/magit/forge)) is now part of Spacemacs/[magit](http://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+source-control/github/README.html). No need to add furtherconfiguration to your `init.el`. Today I was trying to send an issue for on one ofmy repo and I figured out that there's [some trouble](https://github.com/magit/ghub/issues/81) at the moment. `#emacs`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-05</a>: &#x1f4d6; Zoé Valdés, _Une habanera à Paris_ (Gallimard, 2005)<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-05</a>: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/fr/album/stories-from-the-city-stories-from-the-sea/14714439" type="application/rss+xml" class="iconfont icon-music" title="rss"></a> &nbsp; PJ Harvey, _Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea_.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-05</a>: A [recent tweet](https://twitter.com/nickchk/status/1092191876260589568) reminded me of [gtools](https://github.com/mcaceresb/stata-gtools), a Stata package that aims to speed upbuilt-in command for data wrangling. I should give it a go. `#stata`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-05</a>: Death Cab for Cutie, _Thank You for Today_. Just streaming the Apple alt' radio:<br>![](/img/2019-02-05-21-12-39.png)<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-05</a>: I am not very lucky with Spacemacs these days. Now, `SPC-/` to search project fortext (aka, `spacemacs/search-project-auto`) is no longer working. Not funny, trustme. `#emacs`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-05</a>: [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) and [Feather](https://github.com/wesm/feather) are two interesting projects that I think should beavailable in data science-related PLs. Recently, Rust joined the list, at leastregarding Arrow: [DataFusion: A Rust-native Query Engine for Apache Arrow](http://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/02/04/datafusion-donation/). `#rust`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-05</a>: [Hacker Tools](https://hacker-tools.github.io): A user-friendly introduction to various command line utilities,editors and VCS. (via [@newsycombinator](https://twitter.com/newsycombinator/status/1092709841431347200))<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-06</a>: Back to a fully functional Spacemacs, after a complete reinstall. Some minorannoyances with MELPA actually, but nothing serious; fixed a weird bug with the`ocaml` layer, since I learned that the `syntax-version` layer should come before`ocaml`, but otherwise everything is fine. Also, I'm trying to go all Helminstead of Ivy. `#emacs`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-07</a>: After attending months of Twitter discussion about what could be the bestsoftware--R or Python--for data science several months ago, this is now the timeof the R vs. Stata debate, [here](https://twitter.com/jepusto/status/1092255032500764673) and [there](https://twitter.com/jeremyfreese/status/1093209317317038081). Arguably, Stata is a paid softwareand does not offer the same scripting facilities than R for some tasks, mainlynon-statistical tasks. However, what's the point? Did anyone ever mentioned thefact that Stata has a GUI which completely mimics the command-line operations,so that people afraid of typing commands or just interested in running alogistic regression on a well-formed dataset can just do it in under a minute?It is slow with some estimators or optimization approaches (e.g., `gglamm`), andwe had to wait a bit long to get full support for unicode and XLS, bettergraphical rendering, etc. But the versioning system allows to repoduce anyresult prior to the current version of Stata. And it does interact very wellwith Stan and R, too. The question is not which software is better, the realquestion is who's the end user? `#rstats` `#stata`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-07</a>: Found a new playlist on [Apple Music](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/playlist/vol-de-nuit/pl.faeb447ec5a341ef83e7e65189bd1c63).{{< figure src="/img/2019-02-07-18-16-27.png" >}}<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-07</a>: Fun fact: I saved a database from Stata 15 in old format (i.e., compatible withStata 13). I cannot view unicode characters in Stata GUI, but it works perfectlyfine when run through Emacs/ESS! `#stata`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-07</a>: Today I was reading Jack Baty's latest posts and I noticed an interesting[micro-post](https://www.baty.blog/2019/saving-time-with-emacs-or-not) about keyboard versus mouse usage.> The stopwatch consistently proves mousing is faster than keyboarding.I think this deserves two additional remarks. First, it depends on the task athand: For instance, even if I prefer reading email with Apple Mail I use mu4eunder Emacs because I find it more convenient for bulk actions like archiving ordeleting a bunch of messages. Think of it a little: You just have to use yourpreferred movement keys or the arrow keys and strike a key, and it's all done!Likewise, for text editing or interacting with an REPL, I found Emacskeybindings much more powerful than any combination of custom Services or evenTextExpander, together with using a mouse. I believe Vim users would agree aswell. Second, this does not account for people not using a mouse at all. I forone have always been very happy with Macbook trackpad, and I come a lot slowerwhen I have to use a mouse, notwithstanding the fact that it is very badpractice for the elbow and wrist. For most movement, I use the trackpad and I donot worry much about Emacs or Vim keybindings, because there I am faster withthe trackpad. Hence, we should better clearly state what actions are betterperformed using a mouse before claiming than the mouse win over the keyboard.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-08</a>: Just found what I think is one of the best concise tutorial on "[How to GitHub](https://www.gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request)"if you are looking to collaborate on a common repository. As always, it worksbest when you read the [Magit manual](https://magit.vc/manual/magit/) and check what's available there.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-08</a>: [How to blog](https://macwright.org/2019/02/06/how-to-blog.html). Nice take by Tom MacWright. I don't have a very strict schedule.However, I've been trying to post more or less regularly in recent years(sometimes even just links of Twitter bookmarks), specifically to avoid lettingmy blog die.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-09</a>: A few days ago, I noticed someone citing [A Computational Approach to StatisticalLearning](http://www.comp-approach.com) on Twitter. I no longer buy statistical books so I can't tell if it isworth a read, but I note that the author of the R package [bigmemory](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bigmemory/index.html) is one ofthe co-authors.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-09</a>: I still read _Mastering Emacs_ from time to time. Recently, I was just checkingan article on [regular expression](https://masteringemacs.org/article/re-builder-interactive-regexp-builder). I have been using Emacs for about 15 years andI am afraid that now I would be far more comfortable with most key chords aftertwo or three years of [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org). This is not that I really like modal editing--Idon't like it at all in fact--but the consistent key bindings conveyed via[which-key](https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key) and the configuration layers for most packages make it a reallypleasant tool to use on a daily basis. I've come to have only Emacs on mydesktop. No more [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) or [Marked2](http://marked2app.com) or even Desktop icons. `#emacs`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-09</a>: Let's start Season 4 of [The 100](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%5F100%5F(TV%5Fseries)>) in a few minutes.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-09</a>: The more I use Org for authoring simple or more complex text documents, the moreI like. I like to think of it as Markdown with better markup for links, codeblocks, tables, and references, and of course there's Emacs inline preview.Except for collaborating with colleagues or drafting short RMarkdown documents,I mostly stopped using Markdown these days. Maybe I should just revisit some oldMd files and just [convert them to Org](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/41619).`emacs-lisp(defun markdown-convert-buffer-to-org ()"Convert the current buffer's content from markdown to orgmode format."(interactive)(shell-command-on-region (point-min) (point-max)(format "pandoc -f markdown -t org -o %s"(concat (file-name-sans-extension (buffer-file-name)) ".org"))))`See also: [Org-Mode Is One of the Most Reasonable Markup Languages to Use forText](https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/).<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-10</a>: After Jupyter notebook, we now get [Jupyter book](https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/guide/01%5Foverview.html). Looks like a seriousalternative to RMarkdown/Gitbook (aka [bookdown](https://bookdown.org)). `#python`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-10</a>: Just found [Racket Machine Learning – Core](https://docs.racket-lang.org/rml-core/index.html). `#scheme`<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-11</a>: Another nice article about [GTD by BSAG](https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/juggling-projects-with-org-mode/). I enjoy reading her blog posts, and Ireally love her website design. Funny thing: I was just reading some [old posts](https://bzg.fr/org-gtd.html/)written by Bastien Guerry on Org mode.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-11</a>: Interesting read. (via [Daniel Lemire](https://lemire.me/blog/2019/02/09/science-and-technology-links-february-9th-2019/))> Though we age, it is unclear how our bodies keep track of the time (assuming they do). [Researchers claim that our blood cells could act as time keepers](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.12897). When you transplant organs from a donor, they typically behave according to the age of the recipient. However, blood cells are an exception: they keep the same age as the donor. What would happen if we were to replace all blood cells in your body with younger or older ones?<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-11</a>: While I usually run Slime for little Lisp hacking, I noticed that [serious people](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51284086)are looking at [SLY](https://github.com/joaotavora/sly), the Sylvester the Cat's Common Lisp IDE for Emacs. It lookslike there is even a [Spacemacs layer](https://github.com/mfiano/common-lisp-sly). `#emacs` `#lisp`<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-11</a>: [Staying with Common Lisp](https://www.michaelfiano.com/posts/Staying-with-Common-Lisp.html). Safe no move perhaps?

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-12</a>: I've been following [Greg Stein](http://gjstein.com) on [Caches to caches](http://www.cachestocaches.com) for a long time now, becausethe site has such a [beautiful design](http://www.cachestocaches.com/2015/8/technologies-behind-caches-caches/) and useful material on Emacs and Org mode.Recently they published a series of [posts on AI and ML](http://www.cachestocaches.com/category/machine-learning/).<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-02-13</a>: Why the 3? Earlier in the morning I was reading one of the latest posts published byJohn D. Cook about [dose finding studies](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/02/12/dose-escalation/). I am well aware of the [3+3 design](/post/cross-over-trials).Incidentally, I attended a meeting yesterday where a PhD student was presentinghis work in microbiology, and they used triplicates. It is interesting that thesame 3 seems like a magic number here, but it is not the same. Maybe I shoulddrop a note in a few days.<br>
