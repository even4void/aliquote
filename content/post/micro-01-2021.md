> In an industry that is notoriously behind the times, a fundamental change is underway. This change is in response to new business demands, including: (1) The desire to price increasingly complex deals with increasingly large datasets; (2) The desire to integrate with 3rd party data to augment pricing models; (3) The desire for faster models and robust codebases that adhere to software development best practices. Excel fails miserably at these tasks. --- [Ditching Excel for Python – Lessons Learned from a Legacy Industry](https://amypeniston.com/ditching-excel-for-python/)<br>

> There are definitely disadvantages to use text streams as the universal interface between programs due to its lack of structure. But the timelessness of many of the programs following this pattern and the prosperity that it brings to the CLI ecosystem proved its effectiveness as a design choice. Text can be read by both human and programs. It can be manipulated, printed, stored, trasferred, version controlled with the tools of your choice. For programs that do not inheritantly require structured data, using text streams as interface provides the most flexibility and composibility. --- [Emacs is the 2D Command-line Interface](http://hongchao.me/hongchao.me/cli-and-emacs/)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2021-01-17</a>: What you need on Sunday evening when you're looking for a specific file in your "Papers" directory:

```bash
alias bibfind="bibtex-ls ~/org/references.bib
  \| fzf --multi --ansi
  \| rg -o --color never '[a-z0-9\-]+$'
  \| xargs -I % sh -c 'fdfind % ~/Documents/papers'
  \| xargs -I % sh -c 'xdg-open %'
```

Note that this requires [fzf-bibtex](https://github.com/msprev/fzf-bibtex), [rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), but the later two can easily be replaced with the standard ̀`grep` and `find` tools.
