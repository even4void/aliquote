<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-11-02</a>: I generated a docset for Purescript with [pursuit.docset](https://github.com/SEIAROTg/pursuit.docset). However, I'm skeptical about its added value. I'm using Dash docset in Neovim via [vim-dasht](https://github.com/sunaku/vim-dasht), and I noticed that oftentimes the online help for simple query like `filter` or `partition` are pretty vague. E.g., in the case of `filter` the very first hits are all about `_filter :: forall r a. Lens' { ... } a`, while none of the first matches for `partition` yields the same result as a simple query on Pursuit (`filter :: forall a. (a -> Boolean) -> Array a -> Array a`).<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-11-08</a>: Editing Lisp dialect in Neovim like a pro: beside Vim's builtin (e.g., `vib` to select inside brackets), [paredit.vim](https://github.com/kovisoft/paredit) (e.g., `[[` go to top-level form), treesitter and [nvim-treesitter-textobjects](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects) lets you navigate around your code easily, and incremental selection is a breeze. I originally used `vv` (init the selection), `va` (aka increase or `<C-a>`) and `vx` (aka decrease or `<C-x>`), but now I just use `<tab>` that other folks often use as an alias for `%`. `#vim`

```lua
incremental_selection = {
  enable = true,
  keymaps = {
    init_selection = "<tab>",
    node_incremental = "<tab>",
    node_decremental = "<S-tab>",
  },
}
