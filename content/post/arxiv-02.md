Here is a quick overview of some papers from the ArXiv. (And yes it was supposed to be published in May.)

1. David M. Blei, Alp Kucukelbir & Jon D. McAuliffe (2016). [Variational Inference: A Review for Statisticians](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00670)

When one wants to approximate a complex (posterior) probability density, Variational Inference is a great technique to find the closest probability density as measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. Here is a [short introduction](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall11/cos597C/lectures/variational-inference-i.pdf) on Princeton.

2. [Automatic Differentiation in Machine Learning: a Survey](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gunes/assets/pdf/baydin-2018-ad-machinelearning.pdf)

[An O(N) Sorting Algorithm: Machine Learning Sorting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04272)

[Modelling palaeoecological time series using generalized additive models](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/15/322248)

[Kernel Methods in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0701907v3)
This is an old publication but I found it while looking to [Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf](http://is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/bs)'s webpage on MPI.


[Data2Vis: Automatic Generation of Data Visualizations Using Sequence to Sequence Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03126)
