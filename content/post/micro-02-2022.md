<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2022-02-01</a>: Update on Regolith Desktop: Now installed on my own laptop for more precise control. Back to a dark theme (Nord) -- long time no see. One of the main advantage of Regolith over, say, i3 or i3-gaps, is that all Ubuntu apps and settings remain available, including controllers that would have to be defined manually otherwise (e.g., brightness or volume control, screen sharing or screen capture). The integration of native apps (e.g., nautilus or gnome-terminal) is also really nicely handled by the WM without excessive RAM usage (< 800 Mo).<br>

> Mike Caulfield invented the term “a chorus of explanations” several years ago to explain why sites like Stack Overflow are useful. Where a lesson typically explains something once, SO and similar sites present several explanations with different levels of detail, different assumptions about the reader’s background, and quite possibly different solutions to the original problem. Most readers may be satisfied by the top answer, but others can scroll down to find one that’s a better fit for who they are, what they are ready to understand, and what they’re trying to do. --- [A Cacaphony of Explanations](https://third-bit.com/2022/01/16/cacaphony-of-explanations/)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2022-02-02</a>: The [Common Lisp Document Repository](https://cdr.common-lisp.dev/) is a repository of documents that are of interest to the Common Lisp community. The most important property of a CDR document is that it will never change: if you refer to it, you can be sure that your reference will always refer to exactly the same document. `#lisp`<br>

> In December, in my article When dropping support feels like sabotage, I was complaining that Apple was limiting the support of security updates to just the two previous versions of Mac OS, and not extending such support to even older versions like High Sierra or Mojave given the amount of people that are still using them. But I was forgetting that on iOS the situation is even worse. --- [→ No more security updates for iOS 14](http://morrick.me/archives/9475)

> What makes old manuals so fascinating to me is that they document the history of applied computer science. This gives the entire field, including tech comms, the resemblance of a past.

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2022-02-24</a>: I thought I would write a short post to explain how to fetch genome data from NCBI the old way, but here's the gist, assuming you want to fetch all bacterial genomes:

```
% wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/bacteria/assembly_summary.txt
% mkdir bacteria_refseq
% awk -F '\t' '{if($12=="Complete Genome") print $20}' assembly_summary.txt > assembly_summary_complete_genomes.txt
% for record in $(cat assembly_summary_complete_genomes.txt); \do wget -P bacteria_refseq -e robots=off -r --no-parent -A "*genomic.fna.gz" "$record"/; done
```
Then wait, like me.<br>
