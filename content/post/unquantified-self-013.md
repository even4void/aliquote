These days look like people just got tired of the COVID thing and try their best at making it a non event. I was supposed to work a bit on Python code this afternoon but I was forced by the ambient heat to take a little more rest than I expected, because of my medicine: it's been 35 Â°C outside and 26-28 indoors almost all day long. That being said, I've been pretty productive the past two weeks, so that's probably okay. I've still got a bunch of drafts lying around in my post box. I hope to be able to get back to it before the end of the month.

My son and I are back to Black List, Season 5. We took a break after Season 4 to watch Westworld 3, The 100, and Vikings (in reverse chronological order). the containment was decisive on the quantity of series consumed in the last 3 months.
