Here are some random links collected the past few days, mostly about Scheme and related languages/tools.

Various scientific packages for Chicken Scheme:

- [iraikov/chicken-dataframe](https://github.com/iraikov/chicken-dataframe), so we get some useful data structure like in [Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/data-frame/index.html).
- [raikov/chicken-mpi](https://github.com/iraikov/chicken-mpi), some MPI bindings for Chicken Scheme.
- [iraikov/chicken-lapack](https://github.com/iraikov/chicken-lapack), Chicken Scheme bindings for ATLAS and LAPACK; looks old but maybe it is worth a try.
- [dieggsy/csl](https://github.com/dieggsy/csl), the mandatory toolbox for rapid prototyping; must check if everything is included.

Others:

- [Essentials of Programming Languages Language](https://docs.racket-lang.org/eopl/index.html) in Racket (see [chenyukang/eopl](https://github.com/chenyukang/eopl) for Chicken solutions).
- [The Scheme and Functional Programming Workshop](https://icfp20.sigplan.org/home/scheme-2020) for 2020.
- [Lispy in Scheme](https://pointlessprogramming.wordpress.com/lispy-in-scheme/)

> Lisp is a great language and you too can trust it if you write numerical programs of 5000 lines or less. You can probably trust it for other tasks as well but I don't have such an experience with Lisp. Please tell the world that Lisp is a great language for numerical/statistical analysis. Those who dismiss it are wrong. There's absolutely no reason to not give it a trial.
