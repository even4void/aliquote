> If someone’s subscribed to your blog with RSS they can read the full text of your article in their RSS reader of choice. RSS readers are good at rendering articles. When you publish a summary with a link to the full article on your website, you’re making them come out of the RSS reader’s window or app into another. It’s annoying. Doubly so if you still have unread articles to return to. --- [Please publish the full article in your RSS feed](https://www.thisdaysportion.com/posts/please-publish-the-full-article-in-your-rss-feed/)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-09-02</a>: Hacky way to get `gf` works with Hugo rooted inline links (e.g., `/post/bla/`):

```vim
setlocal includeexpr='~/Sites/aliquote/content'.substitute(v:fname,'/\$','','g').'.md'
```

I've tried several combination of `path`, `suffixesadd` and `includeexpr` with no success, so I ended up with this ugly harcoded combinaion of root path and extension as prefix and suffix. `#vim`<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-09-02</a>: [HaScheme](https://software.mcgoron.com/hascheme/about/) is a library that implements a subset of the R7RS's libraries in a lazy way, using force and delay-force. When HaScheme is used by itself, it is a lazy functional programming language with the same syntax as Scheme, embedded within Scheme. `#scheme`<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-09-17</a>: I finally got this "rounded upgrade", or macOS 26. As someone who spend almost all the day in a Terminal, it's pretty okay since I'm only exposed to changes made to the menu bar (Dock has always been hidden on my laptops, and I don't store files or folders on the Desktop). Safari 26 was no longer working with comact mode on Sequoia 15.7 (no way to interacti with the address bar other than with using keyword shortcuts). The floating buttons and panels are a minor inconvenience on most apps I use, but still it's a drastic shift in macOS UI. Maybe this is becuase I still own a very old iPhone with a very outdated iOS, or maybe this is just me, like many others. Also, they revamped the nifty [volume icons](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/rip-to-the-macintosh-hd-hard-drive-icon-2000-2025/) we used to have on the Desktop. At least we got a useable Spotlight again. `#apple`<br>

> Why use a language with 0-based indexing for linear algebra other than putting an additional cognitive burden on the students learning the subject?
