> There seems to be some resurgence into the old web now, time will tell if it gains any real ground. It's an uphill battle: Besides most online eyeballs now being glued to social media apps, we're seeing AI take over the way people interact with the internet altogether. Back in the old days if you wanted to know more about something you'd google the term and start going through the websites Google said are most relevant. --- [Blogging in 2025: Screaming into the void](https://askmike.org/articles/blogging-in-2025-screaming-into-the-void/)<br>

> I’ve seen a number of editors grow popular and then wane. At various times I’ve seen Emacs, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, Atom, SlickEdit, gedit, Notepad++, Sublime, NetBeans, Visual Studio, Xcode, IDLE, PyCharm, Android Studio, and more. Some of those aren’t around any more. I’m not worried about Vim getting eaten by a big tech company, or enshittified to feed advertising or AI ambitions. --- [Choosing Vim over VSCode](https://alexsci.com/blog/vim-over-vscode/)<br>

> So, while I agree that it's wrong to generalise that 'Perl 6 killed Perl', I would say that Perl 6 was a symptom of the irreconcilable internal forces that killed Perl. Although, I also intend to go on to point out that Perl isn't dead, nothing has actually killed Perl. Killed Perl is a very stupid way to frame the discussion, but here we are.

> I agree that it can be difficult to make sense of a model containing billions of parameters. Certainly a human can't understand such a model by inspecting the values of each parameter individually. But one can gain insight by examing the properties of the model—where it succeeds and fails, how well it learns as a function of data, etc. --- [On Chomsky and the Two Cultures of Statistical Learning](https://norvig.com/chomsky.html)<br>

> Note that this updates cells live in response to previous cells that they depend on. Not pictured is that it doesn't update cells if their dependencies haven't changed.
