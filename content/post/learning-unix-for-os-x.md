Learning Unix for OS X, from the O'Reilly collection,

![](/img/9781449332310.gif)

This is clearly a book for people not familiar with Unix or Linux systems, and who known close to nothing to the command-line. Even so there is always something to learn along the way.

Things have changed a bit in the meantime: the ftp command no longer exists in High Sierra, the X11 server has been replaced by XQuartz,

The best explanation I am aware of regarding the difference between a shell, a terminal and a TTY can be [found on Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/4132).
