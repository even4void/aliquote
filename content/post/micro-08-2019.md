<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-08-10</a>: Already watched the first five Seasons of [Morden i Sandhamn](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morden_i_Sandhamn). I like this series a lot, and the format is definitely a plus (3x45') for me.<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-08-11</a>: Since [common-lisp-stat](https://github.com/blindglobe/common-lisp-stat) has been very quite the last years or so, I was very happy to find Gary Hollis's [CL data analysis library](https://github.com/ghollisjr/cl-ana). Lisp still has a bright future ahead. `#lisp`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-08-11</a>: Some interesting [resources on Scheme](https://sites.google.com/site/schemephil/) by Philip Bewig, who you may know if you happen to spend some time on Programming Praxis. There are also nice Awk scripts lurking around on his site. `#scheme`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-08-11</a>: Tonight I'll probably end up watching the last episode of [Morden i Sandhamn](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morden_i_Sandhamn) (Season 7). I'm not sure what I'm going to put on the list of things to look at next, but I'll try to find something as entertaining as Swedish or Danish TV shows.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-08-11</a>: [Ease of learning vs relearning](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/08/10/learning-vs-relearning/), by John Cook. Nice points, as always. I have just some minor concerns with the last paragraphs where the author says that the tidyverse is great beacuse of its consistency. First, pending some minor annoyances with the naming convention of formal arguments in base R functions--and recommended packages--, which I always called R's language idiosyncrasies, I do not find base R that much inconsistent. Second, I disagree with the idea that the tidyverse comes with that much conceptual integrity, for what I used to see. Most importantly, there are so many dedicated functions in, e.g., `dplyr`, that it goes against the principle of compositionality that we use to like in functional and scripting languages. Finally, what used to be available in a short number of packages, but especially `base`, is now scattered throughout several packages (`forcats`, `glue`, etc.), so that I have a hard time believing that newcomers could find their way as easily as they would with base R only. Anyway, that's my 2¢, and it is nowhere a critic of Hadley Wickham's account to the R ecosystem. `#rstats`<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-08-12</a>: Reading another of the excellent blog post by Alex Harsányi, [More Timezone Lookup (loading and saving data)](https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/08/timezone-lookup-2.html), I thought it would be good if there were something like a "data.table" module available in Racket. `#racket`<br>

Nice post on BSAG website, as always. I personally don't use Org agenda, although I keep a list of TODO items and web links in separate org files. I once started to keep a daily workbook, but I stopped after a few months. Maybe I should try again. `#emacs`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-08-14</a>: How many of you are still using or even knowing the [APL language](https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/APL.htm)? I remember that Jan de Leeuw played a bit with R to resurrect it at the REPL several years ago, and that Nick Cox used to use J in addition to Stata. Never used any of those two languages, but the APL book contains a lot of useful information on designing PL.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-08-14</a>: TIL about a lot if useful Lisp stuff on Paul Khuong's old website: contents [listed here](https://www.pvk.ca/Blog/2012/01/18/migration-and-synopsis/). `#lisp`<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-08-16</a>: Ok, Fish shell is great: fewer config files--all in a centralized location, btw--, clean syntax. And it works right out of the box without any plugin! Once I figured out how to setup the `$PATH` variable, I knew I will probably not look back.<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-08-21</a>: I haven't update Doom Emacs during the week, except for env variables because I [switched to Fish](https://aliquote.org/post/fish-shell/) recently. I know there are probably plenty of updates on (M)ELPA, but the Python LSP layer works quite nicely, and the same applies to functional languages I use to use these days. So why uopdating again and again? I probably reached the point where you no longer want to live in a 'beta' world, and just start to be more productive with the tools you have right in your hands. BTW, I uninstalled VS Code yesterday: I still think this is the best multi-OS editor I've seen so far, but too much noise for me, and so few plugins for functional languages that it makes me feel like I could just use TextEdit instead, or maybe Vim. `#emacs`<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019-08-29</a>: Well, I [finally updated](https://aliquote.org/micro/2019-08-21-21-01-39/) my config for Doom Emacs, which now relies on [straight](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el) to manage all packages. The first upgrade was quite buggy, but once I figured out I could just delete my current `.emacs.d` and start from scratch again, I got a working install in a few minutes. Beware that the process of downloading and configuring all packages is quite long. You will also likely need to update your autoloads, e.g., `doom refresh -f`. Also, if you have a problem rebuilding the pdf-tools viewer, eval this before running `pdf-tools-install`: `(setenv "PKG_CONFIG_PATH" "/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/Cellar/libffi/3.2.1/lib/pkgconfig")`. `#emacs`<br>
