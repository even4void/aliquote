> All mainstream, general purpose programming languages are (basically) Turing-complete, and therefore any programme you can write in one you can, in fact, write in another. There is a computational equivalence between them. The main differences are instead in the expressiveness of the languages, the guardrails they give you, and their performance characteristics (although this is possibly more of a runtime/compiler implementation question). --- [Why Haskell?](https://www.gtf.io/musings/why-haskell)<br>

> Stick with the mainstream & boring unless a competing alternative that is so much simpler and/or more powerful, and that has an acceptable learning curve, so that it will justify leaving the flock, exists. Best [resume](https://gwn.wtf/resume.html) I read in a while.<br>

> If we do not understand both the data and the models completely, it becomes very difficult to spot problems in the software we use to work on them: unexpected behaviour arising from software bugs may be mistaken for a peculiarity in either of them. It is then crucial that we minimise the chances of this happening by applying all the best engineering practices we have at our disposal. --- [The Pragmatic Programmer for Machine Learning](https://ppml.dev/).<br>
