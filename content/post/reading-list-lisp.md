Randoms musings on the www from Sunday -- on lisp, mostly. Note that most[^1] search queries were performed on DuckDuckGo. There may be better hits via Google, but I rarely use Google these days. Originally, I was interested in Vim+Clojure, Clojure+Racket versus CL, in no particular order (time, reputation, etc.). Some posts may be outdated, some others were already cited on the micro-blog. In any case, this led me to update RSS feeds, and the associated [OPML file](/files/chl.opml) that I keep on this site. Feel free to grab it if you like.
