As a sequel of [this previous post](/post/mathematica-book-review), here are two other books on Mathematica that I read this year.

### An Engineer's Guide to Mathematica (Magrad, 2014)

This book is organized in two independent parts. Part 1 summarizes Mathematica syntax. It covers basic math expressions, but also strings and quantities, which were introduced as `Quantity` in Mathematica 9. The author then describes how to manipulate lists and arrays, and how to define pure functions or custom modules. Symbolic and numerical mathematical applications are discussed in chapters 4 and 5, while the last two chapters deal with static and interactive graphics.

Part 2 is about engineering applications, but I was only interested in chapter 9 which deals with statistics.

### Essentials of Programming in Mathematica (Wellin, 2016)
