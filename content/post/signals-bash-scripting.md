I was reminded of signals in shell scripts, after reading some arcane Bash code a few months ago. What are signals, and how can they be used in shell scripts? The kernel sends signals to running processes about ongoing events. If you type `trap -l` in your terminal you'll a list of all available signals, with both their number and their name. Either one can be used to reference a given signal. See the [Bash manual] for more information.

I don't remember what script caught my attention, but the gist of it is that you can easily monitor `SIGHUP` or `SIGINT` signals in a shell script, as you would do with other environmental variables or user input.

Without further ado, here's a sample script which catch up eventual user interrupt (`Ctrl-C`) when an external program is running :

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

trap "echo User interrupt; exit" SIGINT

ghc -e 'iterate (\x -> ((1103515245 * x) + 12345 `mod` 2^31)) 1'
```

The congruential generator above is not great of course.[^1] To generate an infinite sequence of random number generator, consider the more elaborated solution below:[^2]

```haskell
import System.Random

main = do
  g <- newStdGen
  (randoms g :: [Double])
```

A similar approach is discussed in [this blog post]. Other options are discussed on [Stack Overflow]. Another nice usage of the `trap` command is to clean up intermediate or temporary files in case the program carshes. See an exemple in [this article].

[^1]: It was the original BSD `rand()` function, though.
[^2]: You will likely need to install the `random` package since it does not come with default install of Stack or GHCup.
