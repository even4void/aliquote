Here is the latest bag of tweets<sup>\*</sup>, which covers March 2019.

<!--more-->

(\*) These are interesting news that I found on Twitter and that I archive periodically. Note that I have slightly updated reporting and fetching methods so that you will get between 80 and 120 of my most recent favorites from my Twitter account (`@even4void`).

- 2019-03-06 @MarcoWirthlin: @kaz_yos There is also a LaTeX package just for DAGs and Bayesian nets. The experience so far has been better than with yEd, because LaTeX supports math symbols and the graphs adapt better to de report. https://t.co/ocKy9K01lk
- 2019-03-06 @math3ma: A nice fact I like: Every matrix corresponds to a graph, and so familiar things (e.g. matrix multiplication) have nice pictures!

- 2019-03-07 @\_wilfredh: The thing about memory ownership is that it's intrinsic (not incidental) complexity on a physical computer. If you don't want GC, you need ownership. Not all languages provide ownership tooling though (e.g. C). Following Rust's success I suspect we'll see more ownership tools. https://t.co/CCmCnX381M

- 2019-03-09 @randomjohn: @abmathewks Part of it is legacy systems, part is the mystique surrounding "validated systems", and part is the fact that SAS instituted certification a long time ago and enabled people to build careers around this one piece of software.
- 2019-03-09 @kjhealy: BTW if you're scatterplotting two scaled variables, then you can use ggforce's geom_circle() to e.g. draw circles to show which observations are within 1 and 2 standard deviations of the mean. Use coord_fixed() to make sure the circles stay circular when drawn. https://t.co/R8mKU2tx7p
