> Build systems for small programs or libraries will often spend 10+ seconds running configure and complete the actual compilation and linking in a fraction of that time.

> In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams mentions an extremely dull planet, inhabited by a bunch of depressed humans and a certain breed of animals with sharp teeth which communicate with the humans by biting them very hard in the thighs. This is strikingly similar to UNIX, in which the kernel communicates with processes by sending paralyzing or deadly signals to them. Processes may intercept some of the signals, and try to adapt to the situation, but most of them don't. --- [The TTY demystified](https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/index.php)<br>

> In the Linux community I often heard the call that surely now is the year of the Linux desktop, where Linux would be ready to be used by ordinary people. The point where finally Linux would be as good as Windows. For me, it is now nearly 20 years of Linux desktop. The call has stopped, mostly because the desktop is not as important anymore. Desktops are mostly used to display a browser and browsers are available everywhere. Also there are smartphones and most of them run Linux. --- [My Linux History](https://beza1e1.tuxen.de/my_linux_history.html)<br>

> Mac OS X is Apple's effort to create a best-of-both-breeds operating system which directly leverages the advances and experience Apple has in the user experience arena and the well-established power of BSD. Mac OS X begins with a BSD foundation called Darwin. On Darwin we build the programming toolkits from Mac OS which we call Carbon, which in turn enables us to layer on the new user interface known as Aqua. Carbon also provides a straightforward transition strategy for our existing application base. We also provide a toolkit called Cocoa, which is an object-oriented API derived from NeXT's OpenStep. --- [The Challenges of Integrating the Unix and Mac OS Environments](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/usenix2000/invitedtalks/sanchez_html/sanchez.html)<br>

> If you want a single piece of advice to reduce your bug count, it’s this: Re-read your code frequently. After writing a few lines of code (3 to 6 lines, a short block within a function), re-read them.
