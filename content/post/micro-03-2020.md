> Clojure is (slowly) eating the world. Honestly, we should be thankful that the language continues to grow despite being fairly unorthodox, compared with the current norm of typed functional languages and the massive sea of object-oriented code that’s out there.  It’s also the odd child in the Lisp family with its functional, data-driven, and interop-heavy approach to programming. --- [Clojure: the Lisp that wants to spread](https://simongray.github.io/essays/spread.html)<br>

> Complexity often does introduce qualitative differences. Although it sounds implausible, it might turn out that above a certain level of complexity, a machine ceased to be predictable, even in principle, and started doing things on its own account, or, to use a very revealing phrase, it might begin to have a mind of its own. --- [Minds, Machines and Gödel](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/Godel/mmg.html)<br>

> By combining a couple of Unix command line into a pipeline you can quickly obtain answers to questions that crop up in software development, production engineering (or site reliability engineering or IT operations depending on where you work), and business analytics. In most cases such answers aren't directly available from existing applications and other methods for obtaining them would require you to write a dedicated program or script. --- [Seven reasons to add Unix command line expertise to your tool chest](https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20200316/)<br>

> Rust has also mostly replaced Go as my go-to language for writing small performance-sensitive programs, like the numerical simulators I use a lot. Go replaced C in that role for me, and joined R and Python as my day-to-day go-to tools. I've found that I still spend more time writing a Rust program than I do Go, and more than C (except where C is held back by a lack of sane data structures and string handling). I've also found that programs seem more likely to work on their first run, but haven't made any effort to quantify that. --- [Two Years With Rust](http://brooker.co.za/blog/2020/03/22/rust.html)<br>

> Another big benefit of RSS is that you curate your own feeds. You get to choose what you subscribe to in your feed reader, and the order in which the posts show up. You might prefer to read the oldest posts first, or the newest. You might group your feeds by topic or another priority. You are not subjected to the “algorithmic feed” of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, where they choose the order for you. You won’t miss your friends’ posts because the algorithm decided to suppress them, and you are not forced to endure ads disguised as content (unless a feed you subscribe to includes ads inside their posts). --- [How to read RSS in 2020](https://laurakalbag.com/how-to-read-rss-in-2020/)<br>

> Programming is essentially about certain 'data structures' and functions between them. Algebra is essentially about certain 'algebraic structures' and functions between them.

> Log only impure actions. (...) You may still have some code that occasionally executes impure actions, but largely, most of the code is pure. If you know the inputs to all the pure code, you can reproduce that part of the code. This means that you only need to log the non-deterministic parts: the impure actions. Particularly, you need to log the outputs from the impure actions, because these impure output values become the inputs to the next pure block of code. --- [Repeatable execution](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2020/03/23/repeatable-execution/)<br>
