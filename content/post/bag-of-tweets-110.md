Here is the latest bag of tweets<sup>\*</sup>, which covers May 2019.

<!--more-->

(\*) These are interesting news that I found on Twitter and that I archive periodically. Note that I have slightly updated reporting and fetching methods so that you will get between 80 and 120 of my most recent favorites from my Twitter account (`@even4void`).

- 2019-05-10 @statsepi: Regress weight on height and take the residual. That is conceptually the same as a BMI.
