> An increasing number of command-line software programs output text with ANSI color escape codes by default. While some developers and users obviously prefer seeing these colors, many users don’t. Unfortunately, every new piece of software seems to have a different way of disabling colored text output and some software has no way at all. --- [NO_COLOR](https://no-color.org/)<br>

> In reply to this criticism one is normally reminded that Unix was invented for a PDP7, which had about as much memory as an earthworm and CPU power to match. That is, the user interface was designed to minimize the time required to decode a command. That meant short, fixed-case, commands, and no minimum matching. But 1969 is a long time ago, and both memory and speed have improved a thousandfold since then. --- [A Requiem for a Dying Operating System](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~blj/funny/requium.html)Still, I like short command names like `rm` or `ls`.<br>

> Longer functions contain more code, and the more code developers write the more mistakes they are likely to make.<br> But wait, the evidence shows that most reported faults occur in short functions.<br> This is true, at least in Java. It is also true that most of a Java program’s code appears in short methods (in C 50% of the code is contained in functions containing 114 or fewer lines, while in Java 50% of code is contained in methods containing 4 or fewer lines). It is to be expected that most reported faults appear in short functions. --- [Impact of function size on number of reported faults](http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2020/09/06/impact-of-function-size-on-number-of-reported-faults/)<br>

> There exists however one common trait for virtually all of text editors: they are written by and for developers. Consequently, design is generally not the primary concern and the final product does not usually enforce best recommendations in terms of appearance, interface design or even user interaction. The most striking example is certainly the syntax colorization that seems to go against every good de- sign principles in a majority of text editors and the motto guiding design could be summarized by “Let’s add more colors” (using regex). --- [On the design of text editors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06030)<br>

> The underlying issue is the non-collapsibility of ORs and HRs. Non-collapsibility means that the conditional ratio is different from the marginal (unadjusted) ratio even in the complete absence of confounding (as in our example dataset below). By the way, don’t make the mistake of concluding that non-collapsibility is undesirable. Any measure that has the potential for summarizing a treatment effect with one constant for all types of patients will be non-collapsible when the outcome is categorical or represents time to event1. Collapsible measures such as absolute risk reduction and relative risk reduction must vary over risk factors (creating mathematical but not subject-matter-relevant interactions), otherwise probabilities will arise that are outside the allowable range of [0,1]. Log odds and log hazard ratios have an unlimited ranges and can possibly apply to everyone. This makes them good bases for studying heterogeneity of treatment effect. --- [Unadjusted Odds Ratios are Conditional](https://www.fharrell.com/post/marg/).<br>
