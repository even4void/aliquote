Today's exercice from [Programming Praxis](https://programmingpraxis.com/2018/05/04/linked-list-exercises/) is about linked lists. Specifically, we would like to be able to do the following: (1) Take a list of integers and rearrange it so all the even integers appear before all the odd integers, with both evens and odds appearing in the output in the same order as the input; (2) Take a list of integers, split it into two lists each containing alternate elements from the input list, then join the two lists back together; and (3) Take a list of integers and rearrange it so alternate nodes are each greater than their two adjacent nodes; in other words, the integers are in alternating high-low order.
