Next in the series of Mac applications, here is a brief review of a fantastic native browser for online and offline documentation: [Dash](various). It is available for iOS and OS X, with a [long relation with AppStore](https://blog.kapeli.com), and although you have to pay for it, it is worth the bill.

> Dash gives your Mac instant offline access to 200+ API documentation sets.

In case you don't know what Dash is, I invite you to consult the [website](https://kapeli.com/dash) where you will find the list of supported languages. Not only the core languages that you can access via standard docsets, but also the extended packages available as user-contributed or 3rd party toolsets.

You can even read [The Racket Guide](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/index.html) in Dash as shown below. (Actually, I read the entire manual this way.)

Two things are noteworthy: (1) you can annotate any docset and (2) you can build your custom docset from various sources.
