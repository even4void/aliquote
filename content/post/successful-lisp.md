Here are some words about _Successful Lisp_, by David Lamkins. I started reading it in the Summer, then stopped, then get at it again. Meanwhile, I haven't wrote a single line of CL... A short review appeared years ago on [Eli Bendersky][]'s website.

> In Lisp, the parenthesis is the punctuation.

This book is available on one of [Gilbert Strandh][]'s websites. It aims at describing what Lisp is, what it is good for, and how the language differs from other languages mostly derived from Algol. The above quote is just a joke, since many newcomers to Lisp-based languages seem to dislike those pesky parentheses that sit everywhere in Lisp or Scheme code blocks.[^1]

As stated above, this is a book about Lisp, the language, and not Lisp as used in scientific computing or AI applications. Chapter 3 provides a brief overview of essential Lisp concepts: syntax and evaluation of forms (atoms and lists) using prefix notation, special forms and macros, etc. It is organized as a set of 12 lessons, along with non-trivial illustrations sometimes (e.g., `setq` versus `set`).

[^1]: I do, on the contrary, like them from a purely syntactically viewpoint, at least much better than significant indentation like in Python or Haskell. If you think about it a little, there's not much of a difference between the following two statements: `print("Hello")` and `(pprint "Hello")`. By the way, John D. Cook already mentioned this on Twitter years ago. If your text editor supports bracket matching --- and you're not forced to use Emacs --- you will easily navigate between balanced parenthesis, and more generally the highly structured code that Lisp or Scheme provide. I also hope that [treesitter][] will be a great help in the future. After this brief parenthesis, let's return to the subject of this post.
