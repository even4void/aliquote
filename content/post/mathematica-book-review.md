Here are my very first impressions on some of the books on Mathematica that I read recently.

### Mathematica Data Analysis (Suchok, 2015)

I did not really like this book[^1] but I did learn some useful trick for munging data using Mathematica. Note that when I say I did not like the book, it mostly has to do with like the structure of the book itself, and the shortcuts that the author took here and there. It is like the author assumes that the reader already know Mathematica higher-order functions or that `/@` is a shorthand for `Map`, and there's no logic ni how data are processed. It looks like a series of recipes, and we don't learn how to think "in Mathematica" to manage data.

### Mathematica Data Visualization (Saquib, 2014)

Same complaint here. Again, it assumes that the reader is already familiar with data munging in Mathematica, and the introductory second chapter only covers basic properties of lists and functions. Then, CSV data files are imported using the magic `Import`, and some illustrations using `ListPLot` are given together with information about customizing the resulting output. Chapter 3 deals with time series while chapter 4 introduces more elaborated charts (histograms, similarity maps, wordcloud, graph and chord diagrams). Together with the short discussion on high-dimensional data, these were the most interesting parts of the book.

### Mathematica by Example (Abell & Braselton, 2021)

### Mathematica in Action

### An Engineer's Guide to Mathematica

[^1]: This pretty applies to most of Packt's published stuff, with few exception regarding [Python](https://www.packtpub.com/product/python-machine-learning/9781783555130) and [Clojure](https://www.packtpub.com/product/clojure-high-performance-programming-second-edition/9781785283642). My impression is that over time the quality of published works has constantly deteriorated, like PLoS One in the scientific field: easy come, easy go, sure, but also the easier it is to publish, the less attention is paid to the competition.
