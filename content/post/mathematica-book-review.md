Here are very my very first impressions on some of the books on Mathematica that I read recently. This is a two part review, other books will be discussed in a future post.

### Mathematica Data Analysis (Suchok, 2015)

I did not really like this book[^1] but I did learn some useful trick for munging data using Mathematica. Note that when I say I did not like the book, it mostly has to do with like the structure of the book itself, and the shortcuts that the author took here and there. It is like the author assumes that the reader already know Mathematica higher-order functions or that `/@` is a shorthand for `Map`, and there's no logic ni how data are processed. It looks like a series of recipes, and we don't learn how to think "in Mathematica" to manage data.

### Mathematica Data Visualization

Same complaint here.

### Mathematica by Example

### Mathematica in Action

### An Engineer's Guide to Mathematica

[^1]: This pretty applies to most of Packt's published stuff, with few exception regarding [Python](https://www.packtpub.com/product/python-machine-learning/9781783555130) and [Clojure](https://www.packtpub.com/product/clojure-high-performance-programming-second-edition/9781785283642). My impression is that over time the quality of published works has constantly deteriorated, like PLoS One in the scientific field: easy come, easy go, sure, but also the easier it is to publish, the less attention is paid to the competition.
