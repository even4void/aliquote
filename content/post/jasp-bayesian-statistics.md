I installed [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/) recently as I wanted to see how it evolves since the last time I used it (several years ago). Unfortunately, there's no package, tarball or AppImage so you need to install it from Flathub, using flatpak.[^1]

[^1]: With regard to my [last post](/post/why-i-like-ubuntu), this also was an occasion to try out flatpak. Overall, it works quite well, it doesn't update itself or its packages _de manière impromptue_, and it is simple to use. Of course, you end up with giant applications since it bundles every dependencies it needs. For instance, JASP is as large as 2.6 Go once installed in `/var/lib/flatpak`.
