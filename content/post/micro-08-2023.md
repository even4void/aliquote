I learned to use it a while ago, after having read Jearoen Janssens' wonderful book, _Data Science at the Command Line_, in its first edition. BTW, the 2nd edition is available [online](https://jeroenjanssens.com/dsatcl/) for free.<br>

> This post is a detailed discussion into user profiles, their directories, and how they are—to put it bluntly—in total disarray on Windows and Linux (I haven't used a Mac in ages, but I assume the situation is very similar there, too). Applications treat the user profile as a dumping ground, and any user with a reasonably wide list of installed software will find their user profile very difficult to traverse after some time in use. There are platform conventions and attempts to standardise things on more open-source platforms, but a lot of developers resolutely refuse to change the behaviour of their software for a variety of reasons (some less valid than others). --- [`$HOME`, Not So Sweet `$HOME`](https://gist.github.com/sharadhr/39b804236c1941e9c30d90af828ad41e)<br>

> Now, I'll be quick to admit that you probably shouldn't spend a huge amount of time trying to install something from source. For many packages the best case scenario is a complicated process requiring> specific build tools and dependencies with their own complications. The worst case scenario is poor or lacking documentation and no idea how to even get started. --- [Try installing from source first](https://www.aolium.com/karlseguin/721a356f-4596-dcce-3f5d-febb026d0705)I did install from scratch almost any app/program on my Mac [15 years ago](https://aliquote.org/post/back-in-mac/). At that time, Mac systems were transitioning from 32 to 64 bits, and it was kind of a mess for some programs. Then I got bored and I choose to rely on Homebrew. Then Homebrew got sort of broken on my Macbook, and I was back at the magic incantation `configure && make && make install`.<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-08-28</a>: As a sequel of one of my last [benchmarking post](/post/duckdb/), here's a rough estimate of Polars vs. Datatable performance when reading a 34 Mb file (NYC Flights Dataset, available from avrious sources; see e.g., [this post](/post/racket-data-frames)):

```python
import time
import datatable
import polars

tic = time.time()
flights = polars.read_csv("nycflights.csv", null_values="NA")
toc = time.time()
print(f"Elapsed time: {(toc-tic) * 10**3:.2f} ms")
## => Elapsed time: 54.61 ms

tic = time.time()
flights = datatable.fread("nycflights.csv")
toc = time.time()
print(f"Elapsed time: {(toc-tic) * 10**3:.2f} ms")
## => Elapsed time: 57.60 ms
```

Polars also offers a lazy CSV reader using `scan_csv`, which is way faster (1.22 ms). `#python`<br>

Note that [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) is available in ALE for Vim. If you use Neovim, the the clangd LSP already uses clang-tidy, or you can just add `--clang-tidy` to clangd parameters. Extra [options](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/list.html) can also be added in a `.clang-tidy` file. See also `clang --help-hidden`.<br>![img](/img/2023-08-28-15-54-39.png)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-08-30</a>: Until now when reading my feeds using [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/), I was simply filtering unread feeds, sorted by count using a dedicated keybinding (`bind-key S rev-sort`, which allows me to simply press `Su` to get the desired output). Now, I learned about `l` which filters unread feeds. It is quite handy since it acts as a filter and the list of unread feeds empties itself as you read articles.<br>

> Nushell isn't exactly a shell, at least not in the traditional Unix sense of the word. Nushell is trying to answer the question: "what if we asked more of our shells?" --- [The case for Nushell](https://www.jntrnr.com/case-for-nushell/)

With recent support for [data frames](https://www.nushell.sh/book/dataframes.html), it becomes an interesting challenger for tiny on-the-fly data wrangling scripts. Beware that it relies on [polars-arrow](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) which (most of the time) require a recent stable Rust. Also, if you encounter an E0034 ("multiple applicable items in scope") when compiling polars-related dependencies, try adding [`--locked`](https://stackoverflow.com/q/76989793) to `cargo install`. When you're done, enjoy the power of data frames right into your shell!With my [last timing](/micro/2023-08-28-12-46-04/) for processing a 30 Mb CSV file, loading the file in Nu shell is a breeze:

```shell
~/tmp> timeit {dfr open ./nycflights.csv}
70ms 682µs 766ns
~/tmp> timeit {open ./nycflights.csv}
1sec 194ms 477µs 961ns
```

<small>First instruction uses `dfr open` while the second instruction relies on builtin `open` command.</small><br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-08-31</a>: Among many of the text-based UIs advantages, I found that the ability to copy-paste almost anything using Vim shortcuts via tmux or the shift+ctrl combo of my terminal emulator is one of my preferred. Here is an excerpt from my long-running (server side) Irssi session, as a tribute to Vim's creator:

```
