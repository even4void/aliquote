> Not so long ago, I was using macOS as my daily driver. The main reason why I got a macbook was the underlying BSD Unix and the nice graphics it provides. Also, I have an iPhone. But they were also the same reasons for why I left macOS. --- [macOS to FreeBSD migration a.k.a why I left macOS](https://antranigv.am/weblog_en/posts/macos_to_freebsd/)<br>

> Most people today don’t know what the command line is, much less why they would want to bother with it. As computing pioneer Alan Kay said in a 2017 interview, “Because people don’t understand what computing is about, they think they have it in the iPhone, and that illusion is as bad as the illusion that ‘Guitar Hero’ is the same as a real guitar.” --- [Command Line Interface Guidelines](https://clig.dev/)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2020-12-11</a>: I haven't updated my Emacs config since July. Same for my dot files, which appear to be stabilized after several months of tricking zsh, vim, emacs & Co. Finally, I wrote no blog post the last two months. I must be busy with something else, I yet have to know with what.<br>

> The Macintosh was designed under a number of constraints, including: (1) It needed to sell to "naive users," that is, users without any previous computer experience. (2) It was targeted at a narrow range of applications (mostly office work, though entertainment and multimedia applications have been added later in ways that sometimes break slightly with the standard interface). (3) It controlled relatively weak computational resources (originally a non-networked computer with 128KB RAM, a 400KB storage device, and a dot-matrix printer). (4) It was supported by highly impoverished communication channels between the user and the computer (initially a small black-and-white screen with poor audio output, no audio input, and no other sensors than the keyboard and a one-button mouse). (5) It was a standalone machine that at most was connected to a printer. --- [The Anti-Mac Interface](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/anti-mac-interface/)<br>

> So, I stopped using the Gmail web client. Google the data kraken, Google the spearhead of surveilance capitalism. I don’t want to live in front of the camera with algorithms watching my every move, using the data they gather about me to manipulate me into voting for this or for that, or to buy this or that. “And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” And remember, “Don’t be evil” was a part of Google’s Code of Conduct from 2000 to 2018. They removed it. --- [Rmail](https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2020-12-17_Rmail)As I now start Emacs from scratch, with a minimal `init.el` file (just to load a monochrome theme, really), I come to appreciate the default settings, although I will need to tweak the base config a bit.<br>
