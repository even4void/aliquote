> "Using the REPL" actually means typing your code in your favorite editor. However, one sends the code to evaluate in a REPL, which may not even be visible at all. Once the code is evaluated, the results immediately show up in the editor, so you get the feedback right away. Obviously, this requires some upfront setup, but a proper Clojure REPL setup exists in all major editors. Just google it.<br> Note that one normally sends the code to evaluate with a single key stroke. Note also, a very important point that people often miss, is that this "sending code to evaluate" is uniquely convenient in Lisp because of the parentheses.<br> There's a notion of "form" in Lisp, that is the code enclosed between a pair of parentheses, which can be independently evaluated. So, when next time someone insists that their favorite non-Lisp language also has a REPL, ask them, does it have a notion of "form"?<br> The benefit of a form, is that one no longer needs to use a mouse or some awkward key combinations to painstakingly select a region of code first, before sending it out for evaluation. Instead, one can use a single key stroke that means "evaluate the form under the cursor", or "evaluate the form before the cursor", etc, to precisely define the scope and send the code at the same time. --- [How much can a Clojure developer do alone?](https://yyhh.org/blog/2021/03/how-much-can-a-clojure-developer-do-alone/)<br>

> On IRC, features like embedded images, a nice UX for messages longer than a few lines (e.g. pasted code), threaded messages, etc; are absent. Some sort of “graceful degradation” to support mixed channels with clients which support these features and clients which don’t may be possible, but it still degrades the experience for many people. By instead making everyone work within the limitations of IRC, we establish a shared baseline, and expressing yourself within these limitations is not only possible but makes a better experience for everyone. --- [Absence of certain features in IRC considered a feature](https://drewdevault.com/2019/07/01/Absence-of-features-in-IRC.html)<br>

> The problem with most of these comments is that they convey very little information. Often it is just a repetition of the method name and parameter names in a few more words. These comments may be useful for API:s exposed externally, but in an application where you have access to all the source code, they are mostly useless. If you wonder what the method does, or what the valid input range for a parameter is, you are better off just reading the code to see what it does.
