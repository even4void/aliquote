> The benefit of a form, is that one no longer needs to use a mouse or some awkward key combinations to painstakingly select a region of code first, before sending it out for evaluation. Instead, one can use a single key stroke that means "evaluate the form under the cursor", or "evaluate the form before the cursor", etc, to precisely define the scope and send the code at the same time. --- [How much can a Clojure developer do alone? ](https://yyhh.org/blog/2021/03/how-much-can-a-clojure-developer-do-alone/)<br>

> If you’re reading this and you use Sublime Text or VSCode or anything else, and this gives you the feeling that you should or must switch to vim, or that I consider it a lower class of editor and think that the mere existence of vim makes other tools ‘newbie’ tools and you immediately start installing vim and spending the rest of your day learning the modes: please don’t.

> Thirty years later, when Cervone created MathJax, I was amazed again—though perhaps not for the right reasons. I had supposed that the major programming challenge would be capturing all the finicky rules and heuristics for building up math expressions—placing and sizing superscripts, adjusting the height and width of parentheses or a radical sign to match the dimensions of the expression enclosed, spacing and aligning the elements of a matrix. Those are indeed nontrivial tasks, but they are just the beginning. My recent adventures have helped me see that another major challenge is making TeX work in an alien environment. --- [MathJax turns 3.0](http://bit-player.org/2020/mathjax-turns-3-0)<br>

In the 2020s, the enemy of freedom in computing is cloud software (aka software as a service/SaaS, aka web apps) – i.e. software that runs primarily on the vendor’s servers, with all your data also stored on those servers.

    print -Pn "\e]0;$1\a"
    # or, equivalently,

}

precmd() {
    # Clean up terminal title (in case Neovim doesn't restore it to its initial state)
    # printf "\033]0;\a"
    # or print relevant stuff
    # (%~ current working directory; %1~ directory name only)

> I mostly don't care how popular Lisp is. I am not using Lisp in order to score better in a popularity contest. I am using Lisp because it is the best programming language I know for the kind of programs I write. I don't think there is anything particularly or seriously wrong with Lisp. It might be that at the moment it does not provide what some people have come to expect from a programming language (free cross-platform implementation with all the libraries you could possibly want). Whether this will ever happen, I don't know, and I don't care (though I respect that others might). I do think I know that some of the people who want this to happen will have to get their hands dirty and just do it. No amount of lamenting is going to magically create any libraries. --- [What is wrong with Lisp?](http://metamodular.com/Essays/wrong.html)<br>
