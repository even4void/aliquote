<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-04-03</a>: Trying out [J](https://jsoftware.com/)!

```» jconsole

  2 comb 3
0 1

Reading answer [like this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73944783) makes me think I should have spent more times with J when I first discovered it years ago.<br>

> The immediate future is easy to predict, because the same things that has been happening for years will continue to happen: Some of the exciting recent advances will be cancelled out by new compiler regressions due to fancy new compiler features. We users will create still deeper code stacks that racks up latency, even more so with Julia 1.9 now that latency has improved and we can "afford" to do so. --- [Julia's latency: Past, present and future](https://viralinstruction.com/posts/latency/index.html#impact_of_efforts_so_far)<br>

However, the author makes a good point in exposing the different use cases of type hinting.<br>

> Writing lets me do that while also helping me avoid going around in circles. When thoughts are in my head, it's easy for them to get jumbled up. I miss things, and I keep coming back to the same thoughts, leading to the unproductive ruminating. But writing my thoughts down stops that process. I am forced to organize my thoughts in a coherent manner and to acknowledge when they don't make sense. Thoughts in my head are like a mixture of dirty water, while writing is like a filter. It removes the nonsense from my thinking. --- [Why I Blog](https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/why-i-blog)<br>

> You want to work with a co-worker on a piece of software? If you're in the same room, sitting at the same table, looking at screens side-by-side, any communication between those two computers is actually happening [by sending signals] across the ocean to some data center, to some other server and then coming back to you. One: that's crazy.

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2023-04-22</a>: At some point, I should make a chart to inspect how the tags on the main blog evolved over time.
