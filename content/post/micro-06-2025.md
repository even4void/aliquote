<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-06-10</a>: I never could get used to Pandas data frame (while I'm able to use any Scheme or Lisp data frame frameworks, and Mathematica association lists or tabular data structure).  Good points discussed here, although I'm a vanailla R user (no tidyverse): [Why pandas feels clunky when coming from R](https://www.sumsar.net/blog/pandas-feels-clunky-when-coming-from-r/). `#python`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-06-10</a>: I was a happy user of [newsboat](https://newsboat.org) until it stopped working on my MacBook, for whatever reason. It probably just works right now, but since I'm definitely out of sync with my RSS feeds, I was looking for a way to have it both on my old iPhone (this excludes de facto most modern readers, including NNW) and my MacBook. It looks like [lire](https://lireapp.com) fits the bill, although there are occasional iCloud syncing issues (sync time and rate limit). Anyway, that's still better than [Reeder](/post/reeder-app) which does not sync to iCloud at all. `#apple`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-06-10</a>: It’s not going to put me out of a job. This is from 2017 but still relevant as of today.

> At least 75% of the actual job of programming is figuring out what a person means when they ask for something. This is not a problem that a machine can solve for you, for the same reason that it’s harder to build a robot that builds other robots than to just build a robot. Have you had words with Siri lately? Do you think Siri is in a good position to understand your intent, or it’s maybe just searching for command words in a limited lexicon? Do you really think it could find Henry’s stool? Or does it seem more likely that it would get confused and require a human… trained to translate… high-level human-language… into language suitable for… the machine?[Why I'm not especially interested in machine learning](https://storytotell.org/why-im-not-especially-interested-in-machine-learning)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-06-25</a>: I have the following Jupyter kernels installed on my HD:

```shell
» jupyter kernelspec list
Available kernels:
python3                /Users/chl/.local/lib/jupyter/share/jupyter/kernels/python3
clojupyter             /Users/chl/Library/Jupyter/kernels/clojupyter
common-lisp            /Users/chl/Library/Jupyter/kernels/common-lisp
racket                 /Users/chl/Library/Jupyter/kernels/racket
wolfram                /Users/chl/Library/Jupyter/kernels/wolframlanguage14.1
```

I renamed clojupyter snapshot to something more convenient to handle when calling `jupyter console`. I'm using OpenJDK 24.0.1 from Homebrew (which I symlinked in macOS default `$JAVA_HOME`, using `sudo ln -sfn /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk`) and I kept getting this annoying warning:

```shell
WARNING: A restricted method in java.lang.System has been calledWARNING: java.lang.System::load has been called by org.sqlite.SQLiteJDBCLoader in an unnamed module (file:/Users/chl/Library/Jupyter/kernels/clojupyter/clojupyter-standalone.jar)
WARNING: Use --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED to avoid a warning for callers in this module
WARNING: Restricted methods will be blocked in a future release unless native access is enabled
```

To get ride of the warning, simply add `--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED` in the `kernel.json` init file.<br>
