I've been away from this blog for a while now, but I've have been busy elsewhere, mostly drawing in my sketchbooks at home, and tackling various projects at work. Recently we got a 96-core Xeon with 512 Go RAM and an NVidia GPU. I can't wait to test what it does for intensive parallel computing.

I deleted my Twitter account some time ago. Since then, most of my technological reviews come from my RSS feeds, Hacker News, ArXiv, and some targeted DDG queries. I don't miss Twitter, my timeline was a just a giant mess even after several rounds of curation. I left some months before the mass transfer of users to Mastodon. Most of the bright people I was following on Twitter left as well, so I don't regret my choice. But I don't plan to join Mastodon or the Fediverse. Recent articles that discuss the Twitter-to-Mastodon switch and that attracted my attention are: soem of jwz's post as referred to by Tom MacWright in his [montly review][] and [in which legibility comes at a price][].

I've been working on a fun side project using Clojure, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the [language server][]. Clojure is a great langauge after all. It's been 8 years since I promised myself to seriously invest in it and I procrastinate around missed opportunities or other more urgent projects. Same for Julia, since it appears to be much more stabilized nowadays.

I've been trying [Helix editor][] again, but overall I like my Neovim configuration better. However, I should note this really is a great project and it's good there's some competitive solutions sitting around. Sadly, Onivim development has [stopped recently][]. Yes, I too love [editors][].

See this recent review of Helix: [A Walkthrough on Helix — A Post-Modern Modal Text Editor](https://alpha2phi.medium.com/a-walkthrough-on-helix-a-post-modern-modal-text-editor-faf573d16892). It's hard to fight muscle memory, though, even if there's some support for [Vim keybindings](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/FAQ#is-a-vivim-keymap-planned).
