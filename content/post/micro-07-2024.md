<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-07-15</a>: Lot of useful [tips and tricks](https://www.arp242.net/zshrc.html) for Zsh users. I particularly like the `hash -d` approach for directory bookmarks. `#unix`<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-07-25</a>: From time to time, I make a few infidelities with cmus and use [gapless](https://github.com/neithern/g4music) (formerly g4music). It's a great piece of software which I initially compiled from scratch until I decided to rely on the Flathub version. I once generate `m3u` playlists for relevant folders in my global library and they come up nicely in the playlist view. See my review [here](/posts/g4music).<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-07-27</a>: I try to use all the features of fzf-lua, and it's quite easy to reproduce a Git time machine with the `bcommit` command. If you're not, you may want to give a shot to [git-time-lapse](https://github.com/junkblocker/git-time-lapse): It does the job pretty well with zero dependencies (e.g. Telescope, plenary), and it can be installed as a simple optional plugin. `#vim`<br>
