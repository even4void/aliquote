> "Oh my god! They linked in more than 64k of floating point library to compute the sqrt of an integer that is always less than 128!? For gods sake, just use a for loop counting up to 12! Or if a for loop seems liek too much work, how about a 128 byte look up table?" --- [The IDEs we had 30 years ago... and we lost](https://blogsystem5.substack.com/p/the-ides-we-had-30-years-ago-and)<br>

> The biggest misconception about Rust is that it’s "harder" than other languages. But that’s only true if you measure difficulty by how fast you can start writing code. If you measure difficulty by how long it takes to debug, maintain, and make a system reliable, the playing field levels out. --- [Rust is not harder than other languages](https://marma.dev/articles/2025/rust-is-not-harder-than-other-languages)<br>

How Fast Is It?](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/python-3-14-is-here-how-fast-is-it): The 3.14 JIT interpreter does not appear to provide any significant gains in speed, at least not with my test scripts. `#python`<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-10-28</a>: I don't think I need notmuch search and tagging facilities since [mu](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/) and Neomutt cover all my needs. But in case I change my mind, I leave this links here:

On a related note, `LocalCommand` and `RemoteCommand` are also handy in some cases, e.g., `LocalCommand osascript -e "tell application \"Terminal\" to set current settings of window 1 to settings set \"ssh\""` to change Apple Terminal theme when ssh'ing on a remomte machine, or `RemoteCommand tmux new -A -s remote -n main` to start Tmux right when connecting to a remote server.<br>
