While I was working on my [previous post](/post/gaussina-credible-interval), I wrote a quick Python script to estimate how well confidence intervals for a mean or a proportion cover the true parameter value. Since the arithmetic mean applies equally to continuous or binary outcomes (in the latter case, we get the proportion as desired), the code is quite simple. Here is my own implementation, which assumes raw data (i.e., a series of observations for each sample):

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import norm

def twosamp_ci(xs, ys, level=0.95):
    alpha = 1 - level
    xs, ys = np.asarray(xs), np.asarray(ys)
    nx, ny = xs.shape[0], ys.shape[0]
    px, py = np.mean(xs), np.mean(ys)
    diff = px - py
    if np.unique(xs).shape[0] <= 2:
        se = np.sqrt(px * (1-px)/nx + py * (1-py)/ny)
    else:
        sx = np.std(xs) * np.sqrt(nx/(nx-1))
        sy = np.std(ys) * np.sqrt(ny/(ny-1))
        se = np.sqrt(sx**2/nx + sy**2/ny)

    qz = norm.ppf(1 - alpha /  2)
    lower = diff - qz * se
    upper = diff + qz * se

    return lower, upper
```

Then I couldn't resist rewriting this little function in Racket, so here it is:

```racket
TODO
```
