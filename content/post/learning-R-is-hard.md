Something that has always struck me for years is that: Learning R is hard. However, I would say that it's like the Vim learning curve, not the Emacs's one, unless you learned it the rlang's way. You know, there's [some business]() behind the Tidyverse way of doing things. Above that, there are too much shortcuts to learn how to speak R. I'm not thinking of the R inferno or things like that, just the language itself.

For the record, I learned R when it was at version one, and I've been teaching R for biostatistics during almost 15 years. A crude estimate suggests that I was successful 20% of the time. Still, I believe I was a good teacher. However I should note that I was not teaching R the easy way, but rather how to think in R for statistical computing. Maybe statistical computing is the problem here.
