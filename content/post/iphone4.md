Here it is! I finally decide to switch to the next gen iPhone, namely the [iPhone4][iPhone4] featuring a huge screen resolution, multitasks support, 5 Mb photo and HD video recording, â€¦ I was previously interacting with an iPhone 3G (but not GS) which needed to be charged on every day and produced bad quality photos. Now, my photos are, at the very least, "decent".

Here is a nice shot taken in a nice room when I was visiting Edinburgh the last days (click to enlarge):
