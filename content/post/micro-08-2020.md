> I really wish we had a front-end to software even half as useful as this in the 21st C, but technology has regressed massively since the '80s and '90s. Some of the old IDEs, before they became bloated "enterprise" software (because giant mega-corporations paid for them, not individual programmers, so the IDE makers serve their paymasters), started to slouch towards this kind of usefulness but fast and small. --- [LISP Machines](https://mdhughes.tech/2020/04/27/lisp-machines/)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2020-08-03</a>: I got a revived interest for the BSD world this day. Here's an interesting thread about NetBSD versus others: [NetBSD users, why do you use it over FreeBSD and OpenBSD?](https://www.unitedbsd.com/d/90-netbsd-users-why-do-you-use-it-over-freebsd-and-openbsd)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2020-08-04</a>: I recently switch to [streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io) and VLC to watch Twitch streams. Much better than the Electron app on Mac (since the web UI is quite bad actually). VLC further has a "stay on top" option for the current window which is quite handy.<br>

> I've been very surprised and delighted over a number of years now by Microsoft's strong efforts in open source. I understand the skeptics, I was on Slashdot when they tried to sue Linux out of existence and I think only time will tell. I figure MS contributing is better than them hunting Linux distributions for sport. So I was mostly onboard for Microsofts efforts and I've especially found Visual Studio Code useful. (...)

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2020-08-05</a>: I deleted a bunch of dead stuff on my OS (again): `clang8` and `gfortran`, probably installed for R, but I don't care since I already have the latest LLVM (10.0) and GCC (10.2) from Homebrew; [GPGTools](https://gpgtools.tenderapp.com), since I already have `gnupg` installed by Homebrew for Emacs among other things --- it took me some time to reconfigure everything the way it used to work beforehand, well, that's until I realized that there was a separate `pinentry-mac` package to store passphrase in OS Keychain. Meanwhile, I installed a FreeBSD image for VirtualBox, just to make sure I'll be ready the day I will have to leave the Mac world unless Big Sur doesn't turn out to be the same kind of catastrophic update Catalina did. `#apple`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2020-08-05</a>: Using fullscreen or maximied apps with this new "enlarged" font (JetBrain Mono Regular 13) is much welcome for my poor eyes --- not that I have any visual deficiency, but with age I came to appreciate a larger font size on retina displays. Despite [loving Iosevka](/micro/2020-01-24-16-49-36/) so much, especially for writing prose, I think JetBrain Mono is quite a good font actually. [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) is also nice, IMO. Here's the current top five on my apps:<br>![](/img/2020-08-05-14-01-02.png)<br>

> Functional programming is a radical and elegant attack on the whole enterprise of writing programs. It's very different from the "do this and then do that” programming mentality.
