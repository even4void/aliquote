<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2020-01-01</a>: Can someone explain to me why on earth macOS devs thought it would be good to fetch again and again software updates instead of storing them in a hash list? I start to be really annoyed by those perpetual reminders to update my Mac, notwithstanding the fact that I need to wait for the pref pane to be up and ready.

These are fundamentally different types. And in Mercurial's code base, most of our string types are binary by design: use of a Unicode based str for representing data is flat out wrong for our use case.<br>

The impact that another person can have on your emotional state can be staggering. A positive gesture or comment can really brighten your day. It's that feeling: yes, sharing my code was so worth it just to help that one person.

It's sort of a Rube Goldberg machine the size of a house that, at first glance, performs all the functions of a toaster. That hardly sounds like an endorsement, but the key phrase is "at first glance." Once you grok Emacs, you realize that it's a thermonuclear toaster that can also serve as the engine for... well, just about anything you want to do with text. When you think about how much your computing life revolves around text, this is a rather bold statement. Bold, but true.<br>
