In one my last posts, I discussed Common Lisp `loop` macro

Chicken Scheme, which is the current implementation of Scheme dialect I use,[^1] has a for-each construct which allows to write stuff like this:

named let

{{% music %}}XXX â€¢ _XXX_{{% /music %}}

[^1]: It is the first Scheme implementation I heard about, around 2007, via Jan de Leeuw's mailing list on statistical computing. I wrote toy example, stopped using it and forgoet about it until I got back to Scheme four or five years ago.
