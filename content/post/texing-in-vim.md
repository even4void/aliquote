I rarely have to write $\LaTeX$ these days. I usually let Pandoc do the harder stuff, and simply write my plain text documents using Org or Markdown markup language. However, I may happen to write [plain $\TeX$](/post/latex-beamer-21-century/) or edit $\LaTeX$ documents, in which case I appreciate a solid workflow to edit, compile and keep my text in sync with the PDF renderer.
