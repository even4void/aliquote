I rarely have to write $\LaTeX$ these days. I usually let Pandoc do the harder stuff, and simply write my plain text documents using Org or Markdown markup language. I used to rely on $\LaTeX$ in the case of R+Sweave/knitr report, but I rarely have to write statistical report these days. However, I may happen to write [plain $\TeX$](/post/latex-beamer-21-century/) or edit $\LaTeX$ documents, in which case I appreciate a solid workflow to edit, compile and keep my text in sync with the PDF renderer.

Under Emacs I had everything I needed thanks to Auctex and Pandoc, but under Vim I used the bare minimum so far, that is native syntax highlighting and Vim motion. I don't use snippets but I have a set of `iabbrev` that alleviates the need to write cumbersome and recurrent $\LaTeX$ expressions:

```vim
iabbrev <<@ <<LABEL>>=<CR>@<Esc>?LABEL<CR>cw
iabbrev chapter@ \begin{chapter}
iabbrev section@ \begin{section}
iabbrev subsection@ \begin{subsection}
iabbrev subsubsection@ \begin{subsubsection}
iabbrev paragraph@ \paragraph{TITLE}<Esc>?TITLE<CR>cw
iabbrev equation@ \begin{equation}<CR>
iabbrev align@ \begin{align}
iabbrev tabular@ \begin{tabular}{ALG}<CR><Esc>?ALG<CR>cw
iabbrev table@ \begin{table}[POS]<CR>\centering<CR>\caption{}<CR>\label{}<CR><Esc>?POS<CR>cw
" FIXME: Add figure environment
iabbrev texttt@ \texttt{DATA}<Esc>?DATA<CR>cw
iabbrev frac@ \frac{DATA}{}<Esc>?DATA<CR>cw
```

Enters [Vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) which I discovered when I was reading [How I'm able to take notes in mathematics lectures using LaTeX and Vim](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) a while ago. Note that the vimtex+[zathura](/post/nyxt-browser/) is the winning combo here. Contrary to the author of the blog post, I don't use concealing, nor snippets (see above).

Things I like: `]]` automagically close the current environment, you can toggle on/off a table of contents in a dedicated sidebar, the `%` matching operator is redefined to highlight opening and closing $\LaTeX$ delimiters, you can compile and preview your file with pre-defined mappings, and there are specific motion operators (e.g., `ic`, `id`, `ie`, `i$`). And on top of that, you can use reverse (Ctrl+click from Zathura) and forward (`<localleader>lr` from Vim) search. And it just works! See also this review: [A Complete Guide on Writing LaTeX with Vimtex in Neovim](https://jdhao.github.io/2019/03/26/nvim_latex_write_preview/).

To compile Knitr standalone documents, I use the following mapping:

```vim
map <localLeader>k :w<CR>:cd %:p:h <CR>:!Rscript -e 'library(knitr);knit("%:p")'<CR>:!latexmk -pdf -bibtex-cond -f %:r.tex <CR>:!xdg-open %:r.pdf <CR><CR>
```

This is basically what I have in my Makefile, except that I use `texi2pdf` instead of [`latexmk`](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html). My `latexmk` settings are as follows (`$HOME/.latexmkrc`):

```
@default_files = ('main.tex');
$clean_ext = "bbl nav out snm";

$latex = 'latex -interaction=nonstopmode -shell-escape';
$pdflatex = 'pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction=nonstopmode -synctex=1 -file-line-error';
$pdf_previewer = 'zathura';
set_tex_cmds('-synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode -shell-escape %O %S');
```
