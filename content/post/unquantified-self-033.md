Hoodie, the last entry dates back to June 2024. In the meantime, a lot has happened: last year, I spent an uninspiring summer resting up a storm, before getting back into the swing of things at the start of the new academic year in September. Several scientific articles published since the start of the year and numerous students to supervise. A busy academic life. This blog has been quite dead for a while. It's almost like since I switched to my new MacBook I stopped doing anything fancy on my own. So, where do we stand today?

Well, I'll be soon be on vacation, so I've got nothing to do but rest, read and wander around. If I find enough motivation, I'll get back to drawing, but in the meantime I'm still in this state of stupor in front of my pencils, which I don't really like: either I have ideas and no energy to get started, or I draw without really wanting to and end up throwing everything away in the process.

I haven't made any progress on the goals I set myself last year. That's why I don't like setting goals, other than as possible todo lists. I stopped watching Netflix and TV shows altogether. I just kept [reading books](/files/books.txt) (even for that I haven't found much energy lately) and listening to my digital library. I haven't processed all 25k tracks in my Apple Music library, but I listened several times to the same albums. I still use Beets to manage automatic tagging and renaming of all songs I grab from Youtube or Bandccamp from time to time. I haven't downloaded any new songs since a few months now, I believe I'm almost done with my current library. Now it's time to listen to every pieces of music again and again.

I gave [Zed](https://zed.dev) yet another try but I can't stand by anything other than Neovim now. My config hasn't changed since last year, which shows that I've finally managed to satisfy myself with a more or less stable and complete editor. More or less stable, I'm afraid, because I've still spent some time fixing deprecations and API changes since the switch to version 0.11. This is mostly related to LSP and diagnostic stuff, but at least it was doable in half an hour or so. Zed is really great, though. It is a well crafted and well thought piece of software and I believe it will become a strong contender to VS Code. I upgrade to Mathematica 14.2.1 a few months ago but I haven't had time to look at the new features (other than the tabular data structure). I kept busy writing Python and Bash stuff for bioinformatics applications. I really want to go back to Lisp and Haskell side projects.

I don't miss Linux, except for all those things I lost since my laptop crashed last year. I've recovered or rebuilt the essentials and set up a stronger backup system. Still, there're a lot of photos missing from my digital library. My current setup is increasingly minimalist and consists of a combination of tmux and Neovim for everything related to text processing. Evrything is done in Apple Terminal. I have Neovim configured for all programming languages I use, for $\TeX$ and Markdown-related stuff (I still use [Org](https://orgmode.org/) for oldie stuff), and for Git as well. I have LSP and REPL configured as I want them to be, and I rely on the same 5 plugins (fzf-lua, nvim-treesitter, nvim-treesitter-textobjects, neogen, vim-table-mode). Other than Apple Terminak, I use Apple Mail and Safari all day (I still have a local copy of all my emails managed by mu and Neomutt), as well as NetNewsWire. Nothing fancy, really.
