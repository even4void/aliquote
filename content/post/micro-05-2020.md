> Yes, make Emacs appealing and user friendly. But don't forget that a masterful tool in the end requires mastery, which can't come for free. I certainly draw the line at saying Emacs is for everyone. I'm not saying it's only for some sort of snooty "elite" but I am saying that it's for those who are willing to learn, seeing some extra work as the aforementioned long-term investment, and who have the patience reach a worthy goal a little later rather than right this very minute. --- [Making Emacs popular again](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/819452/1480c3a59d3d9093/)<br>

> Oh boy, this is hot! Really hot! I mean why fan in my laptop spins like I’m playing a video game? Oh, it’s because I’ve opened these two editors side by side.<br>Just kidding. It’s fine, but this performance-related pun is still a thing, unfortunately, because each of those editors eats more memory and CPU cycles than Sublime Text, and overall performance is not that good. Why? Because these editors are not exactly editors. These two are web browsers that were turned into text editors. --- Andrey Orst on [Text Editors](https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/posts/2020-04-29-text-editors/)<br>

> Another interesting answer assumed that “the test of time” is somehow a cosmic optimization. But as every biologist knows, Darwinian processes “find fits” to an environment, and if the environment is lacking, then the fits will be lacking. Similarly, if most computer people lack understanding and knowledge, then what they will select will also be lacking. There is abundant evidence today that this is just what has happened. --- Alan Kay himself, in response to the Quora thread [What did Alan Kay mean by, "Lisp is the greatest single programming language ever designed"?](https://www.quora.com/What-did-Alan-Kay-mean-by-Lisp-is-the-greatest-single-programming-language-ever-designed)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2020-05-18</a>: I upgraded to Emacs 27 recently, and I found two little annoying things: there's now a warning about the `cl` package that has been deprecrated for a long time now (everything is okay in Doom core modules, this is just the packages `flyspell-lazy` and `persp-mode` which happen to trigger the warning with their `(require 'cl)`), and Ivy posframe [gets sometimes stuck](https://github.com/tumashu/ivy-posframe/issues/92). I encountered some freezing issues as well, but this [may well be due](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/issues/192) to the `with-no-titlebar` option in the HEAD version of emacs-plus. `#emacs`<br>

> Checking email in a browser is a huge distraction. I spend most of my day staring at emacs, and when email notifications ding, I feel compelled to check; switching to the completely browser pulls me out of my flow. Once you’re in the browser, you realize that you are on a slippery slope… It starts tempting you to check hacker news or reddit (at least for me), and often times it’s impossible to not succumb to it; we all know how easily time goes missing “just checking if anything new popped up on the front-page”. --- [Better Email with mu4e](https://notanumber.io/2016-10-03/better-email-with-mu4e/)<br>

> Great software is defined by more than its objective code quality; I would even go so far as to say that code quality is one of the least important characteristics of software. Especially in open source, the greatness of software lies in its ability to meet the needs of its users, and in its leadership and community to adapt to the changing landscape around it. --- [What Is Good Software](https://blog.aaronbieber.com/2016/08/06/what-is-good-software.html)<br>

> I use emacs, which might be thought of as a thermonuclear word processor. It was created by Richard Stallman; enough said. It is written in Lisp, which is the only computer language that is beautiful. It is colossal, and yet it only edits straight ASCII text files, which is to say, no fonts, no boldface, no underlining. In other words, the engineer-hours that, in the case of Microsoft Word, were devoted to features like mail merge, and the ability to embed feature-length motion pictures in corporate memoranda, were, in the case of emacs, focused with maniacal intensity on the deceptively simple-seeming problem of editing text. If you are a professional writer--i.e., if someone else is getting paid to worry about how your words are formatted and printed--emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the same way that the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish. --- [In the beginning was the command line](http://cristal.inria.fr/~weis/info/commandline.html)<br>

> I personally use “principled” to refer to choices informed by sincere and careful deliberation, in contrast to choices informed by unquestioned defaults that have ossified into convention. A principled workflow considers whether or not modeling assumptions are appropriate and sufficient for answering relevant questions in your particular applied context. Because everyone asks different questions in different contexts, such a workflow cannot be reduced to a deterministic algorithm. All we can do is assemble a coherent set of techniques to help us evaluate our own assumptions and guide our unique path through model space. --- [Towards A Principled Bayesian Workflow](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/principled_bayesian_workflow.html)<br>

> I've taken various detours along the way into learning and using various other languages. I like several of them quite a bit. I just don't like them as much as Common Lisp. The pleasure I take in my work is a significant factor in my productivity. Choosing tools that offer me less joy is a cost I prefer not to bear without good reason. That cost often exceeds the advantage I might realize from using some other language. Not always; but often. --- [Production Lisp in 2020?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23231701)<br>
