> In fact, you rarely have anything to do with the operating system on a PC desktop or laptop, you mostly only deal with desktop applications - and they can suck equally bad regardless of operating system. --- [There is only one reason why Microsoft Windows is the dominating operating system on the PC desktop](https://unixdigest.com/articles/only-one-reason-why-windows-is-the-dominating-os-on-the-pc-desktop.html)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-10-21</a>: /me is listening to "Back In Black" by AC/DC<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-10-21</a>: I guess all is working now ;-) I've converted my automated script that shows current track on the micro-blog (for casual IRC users), I'll just need to figure out how to manage tagging and playlist management under ncmpcpp.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-10-21</a>: Trying out mpd in combination with [ncmpcpp](https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp) as a replacement for my long-time friendly TUI Cmus. I"m still in the process of discovering the functionalities. Everything seems okay on the mpd side -- I even got MPRIS support after reading the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Music_Player_Daemon/Tips_and_tricks) ([this](https://strugglers.net/posts/2023/ncmpcpp-a-modernish-text-based-music-setup-on-linux/) Go solution didn't work for me). I'm just looking for a direct way to listen to my music library without resorting on virtual playlist in ncmpcpp.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-10-22</a>: /me is listening to "Amor Fati" by Washed Out<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-10-25</a>: /me is listening to "Man of Anatomy" by Tom Hickox<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-10-27</a>: I was going to spent some times trying to output the sound of my built-in speakers to my old Apple TV which is connected via a DAC to my wi-fi system, until I realized it is as simple as loading Pipewire RAOP module, `pactl load-module module-raop-discover`. Then, launch pavucontrol and switch to your Airplay device.

The Airplay system is now listed in the list of available devices.
We can even make it the default output audio channel:

Now, since Pipewire supports multiple streaming output devices, much like mpd, I just need to configure the audio source in their config files to get everything right for the next time.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-10-29</a>: Ncmpcpp with no color enabled. Much better for my eyes!<br><br>![img](/img/2024-10-29-18-16-05.png)<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-10-30</a>: /me is listening to "Darkening of the Light" by Concrete Blonde<br>
