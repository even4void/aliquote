## Stata for structural equation modeling
<small>(October 2014)</small>

As Mplus syntax often appears a bit cryptic to carry out basic operations in Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), I decided to write out some of the notes I took when using Mplus for recent psychometric studies.

In what follows, I will use data described and analyzed in Acock's Stata textbook, [Discovering Structural Equation Modeling Using Stata](http://goo.gl/TJ1W8y). Why this book? Essentially because it provides a ready-to-use dataset [describe it here], and the author discusses several applications of CFA models, including tests for measurement invariance, without much technical details. For those interested in a more rigorous approach, I can recommend *Structural Equation Modeling. Applications Using Mplus*, by Wang & Wang (2012, Wiley).

### Multigroup analysis

In this post, I am interested in assessing weak and strong measurement invariance using Stata and Mplus. Both are popular statistical packages, and although these are commercial software they are worth their price, IMHO. Mplus includes more estimators than Stata, but probably we could [tweak Stata commands to mimic Mplus](http://www.stata.com/statalist/archive/2013-01/msg00083.html).

A tutorial on multi-group CFAs with Stata can be found on the UCLA server: [How can I check measurement invariance using the `sem` command?](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/faq/invariance.htm). Basically, measurement invariance can be assessed by fitting several nested models, where we impose additional constraints at each stage:

1. (M1) all parameters free 
2. (M2) metric (pattern) invariance -- loadings are invariant
3. (M3) strong (scalar) invariance  -- loadings & intercepts are invariant
4. (M4) strict invariance           -- loadings, intercepts & residuals are invariant
5. (M5) strict invariance plus factor means are invariant
6. (M6) strict invariance plus factor means & variances are invariant

Configural invariance is usually assessed using M1, the idea being to check that the hypothesized factor structure holds in all groups. It is also used as a reference (or baseline) model against which other models will be tested. Model M2 is the first step to demonstrate weak measurement invariance, that is M1 holds (i.e., factor loadings are as expected in all groups) but in addition loadings are equal in all subpopulations. We only allow item intercepts to differ between subgroups. Model M3 is used to test strong measurement invariance where in addition to loadings we impose that item intercepts are equal in all groups. A more constrained model, M4, also adds the constraint of equal errors of measurement. This model, and models M5-M6 are generally too strong, and hard to verify; after all, we only have one sample, and many researchers would be quite happy with demonstrating that strong measurement invariance is verified. [add reference]

To get the dataset under Stata, we write:

```stata
. use http://www.stata-press.com/data/dsemus/multgrp_cfa.dta
```

To create a standalone text file we will use the handy Stata program [Stata2mplus](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/faq/stata2mplus.htm), which allows to convert Stata data file to Mplus input file. This is easier than using Stata built-in converters since it will recode missing values, remove header, and select the correct field delimiter:

```stata
. stata2mplus using multgrp_cfa
```

This generates two files:

```
$ ls multgrp_cfa.*
multgrp_cfa.dat  multgrp_cfa.inp
```

where the Mplus file contains details about items that were converted and basic syntax to read the `dat` file later:

```
Data:
  File is multgrp_cfa.dat ;
Variable:
  Names are
     female x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 x8 x9 x10 x11 x12 x13;
  Missing are all (-9999) ;
Analysis:
  Type = basic ;
```

The sample is composed of 8,984 respondents, with about 50% of men and women.

```stata
. tabulate female

     female |      Freq.     Percent        Cum.

------------|-----------------------------------
      Total |      8,984      100.00
```

Basic item statistics are provided below, as mean Â± SD and range, and values for Cronbach alpha (unstandardized since all responses are expressed on the same 4-point scale):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

As can be seen, there are many missing data for items `x4`, `x9`, `x10`, and `x12`, which means that the sample size will be considerably reduced when using available data.


### Fitting a baseline model

A model imposing equivalent form on all relationships between items and factors in men and women, but no equality constraints, can be fitted as follows:

```stata
. sem (Depress -> x1 x2 x3) (Gov_Resp -> x4 x9 x10 x12), group(female) ginvariant(none) means(Depress@0 Gov_Resp@0)
(7377 observations with missing values excluded)

Endogenous variables

Measurement:  x1 x2 x3 x4 x9 x10 x12

Exogenous variables

Latent:       Depress Gov_Resp

Fitting target model:

Iteration 0:   log likelihood = -12363.307  
Iteration 1:   log likelihood = -12362.434  
Iteration 2:   log likelihood =  -12362.43  
Iteration 3:   log likelihood =  -12362.43

Grouping variable  = female                     Number of groups   =         2
Estimation method  = ml
Log likelihood     =  -12362.43

 ( 1)  [x1]0bn.female#c.Depress = 1
 ( 2)  [x4]0bn.female#c.Gov_Resp = 1
 ( 3)  [mean(Depress)]0bn.female = 0
 ( 4)  [mean(Gov_Resp)]0bn.female = 0
 ( 5)  [x1]1.female#c.Depress = 1
 ( 6)  [x4]1.female#c.Gov_Resp = 1
 ( 7)  [mean(Depress)]1.female = 0
 ( 8)  [mean(Gov_Resp)]1.female = 0

```

The key options are `group(female) ginvariant(none)`, which indicate that we want to consider a grouping factor but we do not want to add constraints on the measurement model in each group. Factor means are constrained to equal 0 in both groups, but not their variances.

With Mplus, we would use the following script. Note that Mplus does not use listwise deletion by default, so we have to specify this 'non-feature' using `listwise is on;` in order to ensure we are working with the same set of 1,607 subjects. With Mplus, factor means are written as is while factor variances are put into brackets. Constraints are represented by the symbol `@`. So `[DEP@0]` means that variance for factor Depression is constrained to be zero. For multi-group analysis, we need to add a `GROUPING =` option, and this will be used to formulate different factor structure (or constraints) in each group, as indicated by each `MODEL:` step.

```
Data:
  File is multgrp_cfa.dat ;
LISTWISE is ON; 
Variable:
  NAMES = female x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 x8 x9 x10 x11 x12 x13;
  USEVARIABLES = x1-x3  x4 x9 x10 x12;
  GROUPING = female (0=M 1=F);
  MISSING are ALL (-9999) ;
MODEL:
  DEP BY x1@1 x2-x3*;
  GOV BY x4@1 x9* x10* x12*;
  DEP*; GOV*;     ! free factor variances
  [DEP@0 GOV@0];  ! zero factor means
MODEL F:
  DEP BY x1@1 x2-x3*;
  GOV BY x4@1 x9* x10* x12*;
OUTPUT:
  TECH1 TECH4;
```

Results are provided below. Unless we specify the type of estimator we want to use, Mplus will default to an ML estimator, as Stata did.

<u>FIXME</u>: explain why DF differ between the two software!

### Testing for invariance of factor loadings

With Stata, we just add `ginvariant(mcoef)` to constrain factor loadings to be equal in both groups. Using Mplus, we will just remove everything under the `MODEL F:` part, meaning that factor loadings for women will no longer be estimated freely but constrained to be qual to those of men.

Here are Mplus results:

## Bifactor models

Here are some notes on Bifactor models, and their use in psychological or
medical research.

As illustrated in the following picture (taken from Reise et al., 2010; see
full reference below), a bifactor model differs from a second-order factor
model in that (1) factor (or primary units) are not correlated, (2) the
relation between indicators or items and the general factor is direct, and
not mediated by specific factors as in a second-order factor model. As such,
the bifactor model may be seen as a measurement model, unlike the later.

## Book review

Here are some notes on statistical books I read this (academic) year. This time, I will concentrate on psychometrics. Several books rely on Mplus.

- Introduction to Psychometric Theory (Raykov & Marcoulides, 2011, Routledge). This is an interesting overview of 'modern' psychometrics, including factor analysis and item response theory. The authors provide a detailed account of reliability (chapters 6 and 7), and generalizability theory.

- Data analysis with Mplus (Geiser, 2013, Guilford Press). This is a gentle introduction to the [Mplus software](http://www.statamodel.com) for structural equation modeling (cross-sectional and longitudinal settings), latent class analysis and hierarchical multilevel models.

- Discovering Structural Equation Modeling Using Stata (Acock, 2013, Stata Press). I really like books from [Stata Press](http://www.stata-press.com/): they are generally well-written, background information is provided and applications are well targeted and illustrated. I already talked about this book as it was published along the new release of [Stata 12 and its SEM builder](http://goo.gl/DnpsBT). As always, additional material are available on the [companion website](http://goo.gl/w3hBPu).

- Structural Equation Modeling. Applications Using Mplus (Wang & Wang, 2012, Wiley). This is a very nice book, with complete Mplus code to illustrate various models fitted on a short version of the Brief Symptoms Inventory (BSI-18).

- Latent Variable Modeling Using R (Beaujean, 2014, Routledge)
