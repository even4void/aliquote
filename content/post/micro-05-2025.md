<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-05-16</a>: On macOS, relying on `ZDOTDIR=$HOME/.config/zsh` helps to declutter hidden files in `$HOME`. I initially put it in my `$HOME/.zprofile`, but you will need to use `.zshenv` (a symlink to `.zprofile` also works) in order to make your `$PATH` available in Neovim terminal. `#vim`<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-05-16</a>: [What's New in Neovim 0.11](https://gpanders.com/blog/whats-new-in-neovim-0-11/). I upgraded via Homebrew some weeks ago and didn't notice any breaking changes. However, after reading this article, I tried to setup my LSP configurations via the new facilities, and it works like a charm: `root_dir` has to be replaced with `root_markers`, and the `filetypes` parameters is equivalent to the basename (e.g., `filetype.lua`) that I put in my ftplugin directory. It is much easier to manage basic autocompletion via `omnifunc`. I don't use virtual text and I don't really care about virtual lines either, but it looks great. I revamped some of my custom mappings since Neovim now ships with default meningful keymaps for goto actions. `#vim`<br>
