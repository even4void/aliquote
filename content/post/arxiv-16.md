### Looking Back at Postgre s(https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01973)

I rarely use Postgres for my personal hobbies (I usually find that SQLite provides me with convenient cost-effectiveness tradeoff for pet projects), but I always appreciated it for long term projects as well as its extensions. This paper is a recollection of the early days of Postgres in the 80s.

> Postgres was Stonebraker’s second system, and it was certainly chock full of features and ideas. Yet the system succeeded in prototyping many of the ideas, while delivering a software infrastructure that carried a number of the ideas to a successful conclusion. This was not an accident—at base, Postgres was designed for extensibility, and that design was sound. With extensibility as an architectural core, it is possible to be creative and stop worrying so much about discipline: you can try many extensions and let the strong succeed.

### Likelihood-ratio inference on differences in quantiles (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10233)

I barely used quantile regression in my previous life (aka when I was working as a full-time statistician), except in a few cases when dealing with growth curves and newborn data. I came across this paper because I've been a long time follower of Evan Miller's posts. He's actually discussing how to implement a two-sample difference-in-quantile hypothesis test and how to construct confidence intervals based on a likelihood ratio test.

### On the visualisation of the correlation matrix (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12730)

I like biplot graphical displays, despite their subtleties regarding how rows and/or columns of a correlation or distance matrix are adjusted. In this paper, the author suugests "a weighted alternating least squares algorithm is used, with either a single scalar ad- justment, or a column-only adjustment with symmetric factorization; these choices form a compromise between the numerical accuracy of the approximation and the comprehensibility of the obtained correlation biplots."

[Are the Signs of Factor Loadings Arbitrary in Confirmatory Factor Analysis? Problems and Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12937) was also mentioned in my daily arxiv digest. As I am slowly forgetting 15 years of previous work in psychometrics, I find it particularly hard to come back from time to time to such papers. Anyway, I'm happy to see that research continues in this field, especially for old questions like those. Finally, I came across this related work on PCA: [Estimating the construct validity of Principal Components Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12905).

### A Computationally Efficient Approach to False Discovery Rate Control and Power Maximisation via Randomisation and Mirror Statistic (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12697)

See also [Gridsemble: Selective Ensembling for False Discovery Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12865) for related to estimating local false discovery rates in large-scale multiple hypothesis testing.
