After 15 years, I realized I have now written 600 posts on this blog. On 4 different blogging platform or site generators: Wordpress, [Jekyll](/post/blogging-about-this-blog/), [Textpattern](/post/switching-to-textpattern/), and [Hugo](/post/migrating-to-hugo/). I redesign the site several times, but there has been two main layouts over the time. I miss the good old days when I edited all pages, except the blog, by hand using HTML and CSS. I mostly write in English although this is not my mother tongue language; surely I write a lot of typos but also inconsistent expressions, but I hope that French and non-French speaking readers will forgive me. Originally called Memos, this section has become a blog _per se_ even if the fashion of blogs comes and goes but is certainly not what it was in the 2000s.
