After 15 years, I realized I have now written 600 posts on this blog. On 4 different blogging platform or site generators: Wordpress, [Jekyll](/post/blogging-about-this-blog/), [Textpattern](/post/switching-to-textpattern/), and [Hugo](/post/migrating-to-hugo/). I redesign the site several times, but there has been two main layouts over the time. I miss the good old days when I edited all pages, except the blog, by hand using HTML and CSS. I mostly write in English although this is not my mother tongue language; surely I write a lot of typos but also inconsistent expressions, but I hope that French and non-French speaking readers will forgive me. Originally called Memos, this section has become a blog _per se_ even if the fashion of blogs comes and goes but is certainly not what it was in the 2000s.

I also discovered that one of the oldest file in the [public](/pub/) directory on this server dates back from 2005 and is a... Flash applet. There're also some gems from more than ten years ago, before Gist were available on GitHub. Note that many files were uploaded at a later time so that we cannot trust all timestamps for sure. This is the case, for instance, of my PhD dissertation in Postscript which was moved from one folder to another one without archive mode.

I've published various quick stats, especially in this [anniversary post](/post/ten-years/). Now, I would like to show the distribution of the number of posts over years, much like in the [categories](/categories) section. To make things more fun, I will use Racket to extract the relevant data and plot them in the form of an histogram.
