As a sequel of one omy last posts, here are some more bookmarks that were awaiting some kind of a short review.

- [Infrequently asked questions in comp.lang.c](https://www.seebs.net/faqs/c-iaq.html): I once thought about writing a similar thing for common questions on Cross Validated, then gave up since it became clear that it would require way much more time that I could possibly allow for this task.
- [WTF is going on with R7RS Large?](http://dpk.io/r7rswtf): Besides a short but nice summary on how Scheme implementations evolved overtime, this post tries to explain what happened behind the scenes regarding the future of R<sup>7</sup>RS Large which should be entirely SRFI-based, contrary to previous revisions of the Scheme language.
- [A Guide to Undefined Behavior in C and C++, Part 1](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/213): A 3-part series on undefined behavior (resulting from erroneous operations like accessing a null pointer or dividing by zero) in C, as the title suggests.
- [Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/) (): I enjoyed reading the very first book written by Kevin Murphy, _Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective_. Then I discovered that he wrote two other books totalling more than 2000 pp. of fresh material.
- Here is new version of [Modern CSV](https://www.moderncsv.com/modern-csv-2-is-now-available/) if you happen to process raw CSV files in your terminal.
- [How to Recalculate a Spreadsheet](https://lord.io/spreadsheets/): Lot of useful tips and informations regaridng the management of live spreadsheets.
- [Web reading list](https://mattwidmann.net/notes/web-reading-list/): I like when bloggers provide a list of the blog they follow themselves, or directly an RSS or Atom feed. Check out his website too, it is beautifully organized and laid out.
- [Decimal to fraction](https://leancrew.com/all-this/2023/08/decimal-to-fraction/): Another great post by Dr. Drang on continued fractions and their convergents (i.e., rational approximations to an irrational number represented as an infinte continued fraction).

> Code is not literature and we are not readers. Rather, interesting pieces of code are specimens and we are naturalists. So instead of trying to pick out a piece of code and reading it and then discussing it like a bunch of Comp Lit. grad students, I think a better model is for one of us to play the role of a 19th century naturalist returning from a trip to some exotic island to present to the local scientific society a discussion of the crazy beetles they found: “Look at the antenna on this monster! They look incredibly ungainly but the male of the species can use these to kill small frogs in whose carcass the females lay their eggs.” --- [Code is not literature](https://gigamonkeys.com/code-reading/)

- The [Vi Lovers Home Page](https://thomer.com/vi/vi.html) ... this makes a great starting point. Agree. See also this [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37100833). And [RIP](https://neovim.io/news/2023/08) Bram Moolenaar.
- [Symmetry in Chaos](https://paulbourke.net/fractals/symmetryinchaos/): Beautiful illustrations of various attractors.

- [Why Static Languages Suffer From Complexity](https://hirrolot.github.io/posts/why-static-languages-suffer-from-complexity.html): A sound review of statically and dynamically typed PLs, where the statics level is where all linguistic machinery is being performed at compile-time, while the dynamics level is where code is being executed at run-time, according to the author.
- [Clojure's deadly sin](https://clojure-goes-fast.com/blog/clojures-deadly-sin/): Interesting discussion of Clojure's lazyness (as a feature).
- [The Reluctant Sysadmin's Guide to Securing a Linux Server](https://pboyd.io/posts/securing-a-linux-vm/).
- [I'm betting on HTML](https://catskull.net/html.html): "What I mean is that people are not typically motivated to adopt new social media platforms for reasons that may not be entirely clear. I’m not condemning these efforts - I believe there’s a future there, and I’m watching as the development progresses. However, I believe we’re already sitting on a tried and tested solution: HTML."
- [It's 2023, so of course I'm learning Common Lisp](https://log.schemescape.com/posts/programming-languages/learning-lisp-in-2023.html): TL;DR CL looks great for interactive development, including debugging.
- [What every IT person needs to know about OpenBSD](https://nxdomain.no/~peter/what_every_it_person_needs_to_know_about_openbsd.html). That says it all!
