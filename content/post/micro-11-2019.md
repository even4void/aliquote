> I don't know coding at all anymore. Most of the code I write is in my e-mails. So somebody sends me a patch ... I [reply with] pseudo code. I'm so used to editing patches now I sometimes edit patches and send out the patch without having ever tested it. I literally wrote it in the mail and say, 'I think this is how it should be done,' but this is what I do, I am not a programmer. --- Linus Torvalds, on [Slashdot](https://linux.slashdot.org/story/19/11/03/2230223/linus-torvalds-im-not-a-programmer-anymore)<br>

> In its simplest sense, the UMAP algorithm consists of two steps: construction of a graph in high dimensions followed by an optimization step to find the most similar graph in lower dimensions. In order to achieve this goal, the algorithm relies on a number of insights from algebraic topology and Riemannian geometry. Despite the intimidating mathematics, the intuitions behind the core principles are actually quite simple: UMAP essentially constructs a weighted graph from the high dimensional data, with edge strength representing how “close” a given point is to another, then projects this graph down to a lower dimensionality. The advanced mathematics gives UMAP a solid footing with which to handle the challenges of doing this in high dimensions with real data.<br>

Complex systems, such as organisms, brains, and human societies, consist of interlocking feedback loops in which signals exchanged between subsystems result in complex but stable behavior. When feedback loops break down, the system goes unstable. He constructed a compelling picture of how complex biological systems function, a picture that is by and large universally accepted today.>> (...)>> A major fear of the singulariteers is that as computers become more involved in designing their own software, they’ll rapidly bootstrap themselves into achieving superhuman computational ability. But the evidence of machine learning points in the opposite direction. As machines become more powerful and capable of learning, they learn more and more as human beings do—from multiple examples, often under the supervision of human and machine teachers.

> Privacy is a group inoculation. Even if you self-host, there's nothing to prevent your information from being inadvertently gathered by your friend who hasn't taken the same steps. Not to mention that self-hosting is really hard! At its simplest, you need to know how to use command line tools (or, if you're using shared hosting, be comfortable with FTP). At its hardest, you need to have some server administration skills. For those reasons, I don't think self-hosting is a real solution to the problem in itself. There are lots of other great reasons to self-host: having full control of your web presence and data, if you have the means and the skills, allows you to better represent yourself online. --- [Escape from Google](https://werd.io/2019/escape-from-google)<br>

> Darwin itself was originally released by Apple in November 2000. It is a fork of Rhapsody, which was the codename used for Apple's next-generation operating system after the purchase of NeXT in 1998. Darwin utilises the XNU kernel, and currently runs on modern x86-64 processors, as well as 32-bit ARM processors in the case of older iOS devices (e.g. the iPhone 5C).<br>> Many well-known elements of macOS such as the Cocoa framework and the famous Aqua graphical user interface are not included in Darwin, and unfortunately remain closed source. --- [A Look at PureDarwin](https://www.jamieweb.net/blog/a-look-at-puredarwin/)<br>

> Anyway, our point is if you’re going to read a Haskell manual for 10 minutes a day, you aren’t going to become a programmer even in a hundred years. But if you combine reading a manual with watching at least 10 minutes of video courses daily and doing 10 minutes of real coding each day for a couple of months, at the end you will be able to program something valuable in Haskell. --- [How to Learn Haskell in 10 Minutes a Day](How to Learn Haskell in 10 Minutes a Day)Sure.
