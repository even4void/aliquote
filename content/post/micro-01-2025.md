<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-01-03</a>: Neomutt tip: To escape space in folder name (e.g., iCloud Sent or Deleted Messages), you can use either `\` when defining your inboxes in your muttrc or `^V` for your bindings. E.g.:

```
mailboxes =icloud/Drafts =icloud/Sent\ Messages =icloud/Deleted\ Messages =icloud/Archive
macro index,pager gs "<change-folder>+icloud/Sent^V Messages<return>" "go to sent messages"
```

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-01-11</a>: After today's quick testing, it looks like [Wolfram Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/WolframResearch/WolframLanguageForJupyter) is working as expected under Quarto (see this blog post for a previous [attempt with Stata](post/stata-quarto/)). The Racket kernel works as well (minor caveat, you'll probably have to [symlink your Homebrewed libzmq](https://github.com/rmculpepper/iracket/issues/20)).<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-01-12</a>: I've been listening to some music on Apple Music app for one and half a hour and the battery still tops at its max. It's incredible the level of micro-optimization that must be behind all this. Likewise, I can work unplugged for all day long, I will have a fair amount of time left for the day after. `#apple`<br>

> I would not accept this Dock placement blasphemy from anyone else, but from Thomson, well, OK. (The correct location is on the right. Left, we’ll let you argue for. But definitely not on the bottom.) --- [James Thomson on the origins of the macOS Dock](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/10/thomson-dock)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-01-15</a>: I migrated a bunch of stuff to keep Neomutt and Apple Mail in sync, and I still use mu to manage complex search in my maildir. Here are the results of the last `mu index` which accounts for the integration of listservers and digests directly into proper iCloud folders, in no more than 5s:

```shell
» mu index
indexing maildir /Users/chl/.mail -> store /Users/chl/.cache/mu/xapian
| indexing messages; checked: 14443; updated/new: 3103; cleaned-up: 4144
```

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2025-01-15</a>: Related to the previous micro-post, see [Proper Python Project Structure 2024](https://matt.sh/python-project-structure-2024) by the same author, which argues against the use of requirements.txt in favor of Poetry. I used Poetry for a work project but I'm now betting on [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). See also [Uv has a killer feature you should know about](https://valatka.dev/2025/01/12/on-killer-uv-feature.html). `#python`<br>

> Discord, overwhelmingly. Every IRC community I used to be a part of even a year ago has made the jump. It's just more convenient for all concerned- the only holdouts are people clinging to their CLIs and people objecting for ideological reasons. --- [LocutusOfBorges on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15731193)<br>

> I don't understand the desire to shove everything into a web browser. Other than the fact that it is how tech startups extract money from venture capitalists, spy on your user base, and lock out interoperability I don't see why a web browser is a better place to implement most things and yet, here we are. --- [Discord in my IRC client](https://www.going-flying.com/blog/discord-irc.html)<br>

> The lie-to-children here is that we pretend the do block is magical and that when it executes, it also executes side effects of functions called in it. This mental model will take the beginner a long way, but at some point, one will want to break free of it. That is when Haskell starts to really shine as a procedural language. --- [Haskell: A Great Procedural Language](https://entropicthoughts.com/haskell-procedural-programming)<br>

So long CV, but I'm glad to see that the site can still generate very interesting discussions.<br>

> To put it briefly, human experience is characterized by Dasein (a technical term for Heidegger that can be translated literally as “being-there” or “being-here”), which tends to overcome spatial distance through meaningful action or symbolic understanding, to bring even the world close to itself, a tendency that Heidegger calls de-severance. With various modern technologies, however, this tendency of Dasein is made more complicated. --- [A Phenomenology of Spotify and Vinyl](https://hedgehogreview.com/web-features/thr/posts/a-phenomenology-of-spotify-and-vinyl)<br>
