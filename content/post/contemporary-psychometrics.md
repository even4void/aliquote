That is certainly a minor issue of terminology, but what is best: "contemporary" or "modern" psychometrics?

I have often encountered the term *modern* psychometrics when speaking of [Item Response Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Item_response_theory) models as opposed to the [Classical Test Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_test_theory) approach where all statistical indicators rely on untransformed (raw) scores. There is even a book with this title, precisely:
Rust, J. and Golombok, *Modern Psychometrics: Science of Psychological Assessment*, 2008, 3rd ed., Routledge.

I don't have this book but the table of content does suggest that no particular chapter is devoted to IRT, but it rather looks like a discussion of the foundation of measurement and test theory, much like *The **new** psychometrics: science, psychology, and measurement* (emphasis is mine), by Paul Kline (Routledge, 1998), with applications in intelligence and personality assessment.

On the contrary, the *Handbook Statistics, volume 26* (North Holland, 2006), includes a larger number of chapters describing the foundations and applications of IRT models. I recently brought another book which looks very interesting as it features distinct chapters for factor-analytic models, structural equation modeling, multidmensional scaling (an often forgotten aspect of psychometrics):
Maydeu-Olivares, A. and McArdle, J.J., *Contemporary Psychometrics*, 2005, Psychology Press.
Still no chapter on IRT.

In sum, I cannot find any distinctive feature when one is talking about modern, or new, or contemporary psychometrics. Of course, I have a lot of books dealing with IRT models. I personally like: 

- van der Linden, W.J. and Hambleton, R.K. (eds.), *Handbook of Modern Item Response Theory*, 1997, Springer.
- de Boeck, P. and Wilson, M., *Explanatory Item Response Models: A Generalized Linear and Nonlinear Approach*, 2001, Springer.
- Boomsma, A., van Dujin, M., and Snijders, T., *Essays on Item Response Theory*, 2000, Springer.

although the latter is mostly a series of chapters on applications of IRT in various fields of research. I have noticed that Chapman & Hall/CRC now has an "R series" like Springer where Mair and coll. plan to discuss their Extended Rasch Modeling framework (see the related [JSS paper](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v20/i09) or the <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o fa-1x"></i> [UseR! 2010 slides](http://www.r-project.org/conferences/useR-2010/slides/Mair+Hatzinger.pdf)).
