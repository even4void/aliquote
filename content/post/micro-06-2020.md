> If you want to build truly performant software, you need to at least keep performance in mind as you make early design and architectural decisions, lest you paint yourself into awkward corners later on. --- [Reflections on software performance](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/reflections-on-performance/)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2020-06-02</a>: Apparently, [latency](https://anarc.at/blog/2018-05-04-terminal-emulators-2/) in terminal emulator is [still](https://danluu.com/term-latency/) a thing in 2020.<br>

Check out other experiments at tweaking Emacs UI by Nicolas Rougier, e.g. this [large fringe](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/gtb148/some_fun_with_emacs/) or this basic [config](https://github.com/rougier/elegant-emacs) for an "Elegant Emacs". `#emacs`<br>

> I saved a personal, private backup of everything I've posted -- 3,794 posts, not including this one -- and then deleted it all except the first post.<br>First, the why: the internet never forgets, but that's not how people work. "I like to remember things my own way. How I remembered them, not necessarily the way they happened." The person who posted entries here ten years ago is a different person than me, and I see no reason for that older person to stay around\*. --- [the end of livejournal](https://evan.livejournal.com/991055.html), by [Evan Martin](http://neugierig.org)<br>

> Most developers are primarily engaged in making systems that acquire, extract, transform, maintain, analyze, transmit and render information—facts about the world. Most often, this information documents some human activity, be that of customers, suppliers, advertisers, travelers, voters, members, students, patients etc and must deal with all the irregularity thereof. This is in stark contrast to artificial systems, e.g., programming language compilers, which make up their own rules, in fully enumerated spaces, can eliminate irregularity and can reject anything which does not conform. --- [A history of Clojure](https://clojure.org/about/history)<br>

> Everyone is constantly online, and the need for statuses has seemingly disappeared. But has it really? Toggling between online and offline may not be all that useful anymore, but along with that we lost a way to specify whether we want to talk or not. At best you'll get a green dot meaning only “they're looking at the screen right now”, or a note saying “last seen 10 minutes ago” – which could just mean that they woke up, checked the screen and went back to sleep. Combine that with the absurd amount of competing platforms, and your best bet at “hey everyone, I need to talk” is messaging every single person on every single platform and hoping that they respond. --- [I miss being online](https://blog.tadzik.net/i-miss-being-online.html)<br>

Even though GPG has been around for almost 20 years, there are only ~50,000 keys in the “strong set,” and less than 4 million keys have ever been published to the SKS keyserver pool ever. By today’s standards, that’s a shockingly small user base for a month of activity, much less 20 years. --- [GPG And Me](https://moxie.org/2015/02/24/gpg-and-me.html)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2020-06-29</a>: I just realized today that VS Code was using Jedi as the default backend for its LSP server. It's still possible to use the MS Python server: same as under Emacs, once you select that option, all MS stuff get downloaded and VS Code gets pretty unusable for quite a few moments when you open a Python project. That was not [Emacs fault](/micro/2020-06-22-21-00-20/), right? So I'm now back to Emacs full day. What a life! `#emacs`<br>
