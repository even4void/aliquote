- 2018-09-06 @iamtrask: Attention is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of Deep Learning - and this @distillpub is definitively the best explanation of it I've seen.  For #100DaysOfMLCode challengers - try implementing an attention mechanism from scratch.  https://t.co/uOAMulnuoq
