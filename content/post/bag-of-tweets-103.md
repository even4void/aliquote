Here is the latest bag of tweets<sup>\*</sup>, which covers October 2018.

<!--more-->

(\*) These are interesting news that I found on Twitter and that I archive periodically. Note that I have slightly updated reporting and fetching methods so that you will get between 80 and 120 of my most recent favorites from my Twitter account (`@chlalanne`).

- 2018-10-03 @RikaGorn: I've started a repo for collecting all my fav Twitter #rstats #R4DS tips and resources and categorized by keyword (e.g. clean, viz, git, report, etc) it's pretty messy but way better than looking through my likes and bookmarks https://t.co/bcSjYUwTzj

- 2018-10-04 @tslumley: As an example of the dangers of over-generalisation in machine learning, it's hard to improve on the mushroom dataset (https://t.co/yCPlkHh4of). If you train on North American Agaricus and Lepiota species, you can easily get a rule that thinks Amanita phalloides is safe!

- 2018-10-24 @ThomasMailund: Ok, I think I know why c(x,y) is faster for numerics than lists ‚Äî they are simpler objects to copy, I guess. But I wonder why subscripting is so much faster for building lists in #Rstats. https://t.co/0RQHCWQGxe
