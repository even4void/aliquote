Same desktop environment for over five or six months, similar window tiling across session, and same tools as well: Neovim, Irssi, Tmux, Alacritty, Zsh, Cmus, Newsboat. No more config tweaks, since almost everything work as expected.

I've been pretty busy the last two weeks with a new course on bioinformatics for genomic applications. I did a biostatistics refresher too, after a long hiatus (5 years with no teaching at all). It was exhausting, though. Some stuff need to be improved for the next session, but overall I was pretty happy with how things went along the course.

I deleted my Last.fm account (I got the annual statistics I wanted to see, and I'm not interested in any tracking or recommendation system). I didn't renewed my paid subscription to Apple TV and Music, since they decided to increase their rates (at least by 2 € each). I'm almost done with Apple products by now, but I will keep by email address as well as my Macbook which runs fine under Mojave. Mojave is v10.14 while we are now at Ventura v13. I think I never look at the new functionalities starting from Catalina, and I don't think I missed a lot in hindsight.
