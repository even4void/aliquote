Here are some papers that I read this week, in the CS and Stat category, plus random stuff that were mentioned on IRC or Hacker News.

### Distributions.jl: Definition and Modeling of Probability Distributions in the JuliaStats Ecosystem (https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08611)

I reinstalled Julia (v1.6.1) a few months ago. Yet I haven't had enough time to learn the language again. I saw there's a native plotting backend, which is really great, and that there's some sort of JIT and on first load compiling capabilities. It is supposed to improve later execution of scripts or programs, but really on first launch it is sometimes a pain. However, the language looks much better now, although I keep thinking of the old Julia 0.4 that I used to use several years ago now. This article describes the [Distributions.jl](https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/stable/) package, which is part of the [JuliaStats](https://juliastats.org/) ecosystem. Note that this package allow to define and not only to manipulate pre-defined statistical distributions. Specifically, "a `Distribution` is an abstract type that takes two parameters: a `VariateForm` type which describes the dimensionality, and `ValueSupport` type which describes the discreteness or continuity of the support."
