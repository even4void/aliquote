Some sort of vacuum for my Pocket reading list which won't stop growing.

- [Daily Rust: Slice Patterns](https://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/posts/daily/slice-patterns): Slices are great, when you're not off by one.
- [A Vim Guide For Experts](https://thevaluable.dev/vim-expert/): I have read enough things about Vim config, starter kits like [Lunar](https://www.lunarvim.org/#opinionated), tips and tricks, and Vim philosophy the past few months that it is becoming difficult to pique my curiosity these days, but those kind of series are so great. There's always something to learn.

> Applications are bad enough in that they trap potentially useful building blocks for larger program ideas behind artificial barriers, but they fail at even their stated purpose of providing an 'intuitive' interface to whatever fixed set of actions and functionality its creators have imagined. Here is why: the problem is that for all but the simplest applications, there are multiple contexts within the application and there needs to be a cohesive story for how to present only 'appropriate' actions to the user and prevent nonsensical combinations based on context. This becomes serious business as the total number of actions offered by an application grows and the set of possible actions and contexts grows. As an example, if I just have selected a message in my inbox (this is a 'context'), the 'send' action should not be available, but if I am editing a draft of a message it should be. Likewise, if I have just selected some text, the 'apply Kodachrome style retro filter' action should not be available, since that only makes sense applied to a picture of some sort. --- [The future of software, the end of apps, and why UX designers should care about type theory ](https://pchiusano.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-future-of-software-end-of-apps-and.html)

- [Riding the Covid coaster](http://bit-player.org/2021/riding-the-covid-coaster): I usually don't post about COVID --- because essentially we know nothing --- but every math article written by Brian Hayes are so enjoyable that I couldn't resist.
- [Building a desktop application for Datasette (and weeknotes)](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/30/datasette-app/): This was some weeks ago, and it looks like it's already there (Mac only).
- [Keyboard v. mouse](https://danluu.com/keyboard-v-mouse/): I think I already mentioned this article on the Micro section of this site, but it remains a great read. FWIW, I more of a keyboard guy because I always used laptops and mouse is not an option there.
- [Announcing the release of my e-book: Introduction to Empirical Bayes](http://varianceexplained.org/r/empirical-bayes-book/): Great news! I always enjoy reading David's posts, and its R code to solve math problem using simulation, even if I don't watch his screencasts on real data analysis. I highly recommend this book.
- [How to evenly distribute points on a sphere more effectively than the canonical Fibonacci Lattice](http://extremelearning.com.au/how-to-evenly-distribute-points-on-a-sphere-more-effectively-than-the-canonical-fibonacci-lattice/): This reminded me of a post by whuber on Cross Validated long ago.
- [Modern R with the tidyverse](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/modern_R/): Yet another textbook on "modern" R.
