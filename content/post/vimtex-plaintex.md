I very much like [vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex), even if I'm not writing as much $\TeX$ stuff as I used to do in the past. It works very well with standard Latex documents that I still have on my HD. I get live compiling and forward/reverse search with the Zathura PDF viewer for free, and I can also toggle a pretty TOC along the way. I no longer use Context (maybe I should) but I know it is supposed to work similarly. As I said in a [previous post](/post/latex-beamer-21-century/), [luatex](https://www.luatex.org/) is great for it allows us to write "plain $\TeX$" (for whatever definition of plain we agree on) using custom fonts and forget about accented letters for non-US writers. Since this last post, I haven't write a single line of $\TeX$. However, since I was digging into my Neovim config for $\TeX$ stuff, I wanted to know how Vimtex handles the `plaintex` filetype.

And so, it all started with me trying to replicate the toy example mentioned above. It failed early. Okay, let's forget I missed to add a final `\bye` statement. Moving on, I soon realized that vimtex is way more friendly with Latex than plain old tex. Since I already have my own `$HOME/.latexmkrc`, I never bothered checking how vimtex proceeds in this case. It looks like it has its own setting for running [latexmk](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latexmk). Fair enough, but I couldn't find my way to tell it to use an option like `-pdlatex=luatex`. Hence I tried to use a different compiler, namely [arara](https://islandoftex.gitlab.io/). It allows to define the compiler and its options directly in the tex file, which is fine since I would like to avoid adding `.latexmkrc` or `.nvimrc` local config files to a simple project like this one. I also needed to define a `Tex root` directive to please vimtex, otherwise it complains with a "failed mainfile detection" -- again because it [primarily targets Latex documents](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/issues/2491).
