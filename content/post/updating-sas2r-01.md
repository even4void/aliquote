I am slowly updating my latest textbook on using R in clinical trials. This is painful work but it has to be done.

<!--more-->

When I came back to this little R companion to Dmitrienko et al's textbook on the *Analysis of Clinical Trials Using SAS* , I first checked what I did in the last commit. But, oh my! It was almost two years ago, and it is plain Sweave. Now, I am back to finish the work, hopefully. I remain admiring the productivity of some people, like [Thomas Mailund](https://twitter.com/thomasmailund) who, despite life events, keep up the good work with publishing R books.

Still, it remains painful to read SAS code when we have such elegant alternative solutions like R or Stata, notwithsatnding the fact that I am no longer that interested in medical statistics. I am not super productive these days. I never was, but I know I will never be now. Anyway, here we are: I am slowly working on it again. The project is [still on GitHub](https://github.com/chlalanne/SAS2R).
