Some random notes from holidays.

- [Mountain Lion](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/07/os-x-10-8/) (OS X 10.8) is out. I didn't upgrade my system though. Among the major changes are updates to base programming languages (Python, Perl, Ruby). The rest looks like poor little cosmetic changes, with [iCloud](http://www.apple.com/icloud/) as a definitive replacement for mobile.me (previsouly dot mac). All mobile.me services have been stopped, including photos galleries and iDisk (and shared users iDisk). I still have a .mac email address, that I don't use much. Too much of benevolent contributions now depends on the infamous App Store. I don't plan to renew my annual subscription. *Apple, you just suck sometimes*.
- I ordered a lot of books on psychometrics. Obviously, I won't have time to read them all before end of August, but I will try to review them whenever the opportunity arises. Here they are:
  
    * Wainer, Bradlow, Wang, *Testlet Response Theory and Its Applications*,
    Cambridge University Press, 2007. (280 pp.)
    * Thissen, Wainer, *Test Scoring*, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Inc,
    2001. (434 pp.)
    * Guilford, *Psychometric Methods*, McGraw-Hill, 1954. (597 pp.)
    * Jenkinson, *Measuring Health and Medical Outcomes*, Routledge,
    1994. (224 pp.)
    * Cudeck, MacCallum, *Factor Analysis at 100: Historical Developments And
    Future Directions*, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Inc, 2007. (384 pp.)
    * McIver, Carmines, *Unidimensional Scaling*, SAGE Publications Inc,
    1981. ((96 pp.)
	
- I have some ebooks on [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) that I need to read, and I bought five new books from Stat Press. I still have a lot to learn and write about Clojure and [Stata](http://www.stata.com/). I am thinking of building a pedagogical website using the [Noir](http://webnoir.org/) framework, borrowing ideas from the excellent [Smooth CoffeeScript](http://autotelicum.github.com/Smooth-CoffeeScript/) interactive HTML edition. Probably more to come soon (or later).
- I found many nice tutorials on [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/). Maybe my preferred is this one: [Less Perplexing Terminal Multiplexing with tmux](http://bit.ly/Q31dDb). At this point, I am not clear about the advantages of tmux over [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/), besides keeping session alive when you close you Terminal window.
- I published a paper in *BMC Medical Research Methodology*. In retrospect, I am not happy with that paper. More generally, I don't think it's my job to publish papers. I'm no longer an academic researcher, time has passed on me, and I'm probably no more than a slave of others' data. That works for me, as long as I can provide them with my best advices. (That's for the most pessimistic thought of the day.)
- In the same vein, I haven't submit any abstract this year. I feel like I need to concentrate on things that really matter to me, rather than show myself in public events. However, I will be attending many events. I believe it is important to keep in touch with people doing nice work on things I'm interested in, and, of course, visit foreign countries :-)
