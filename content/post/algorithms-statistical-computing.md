Here are two short reviews of books I have read or reread this year.

### Algorithms for Data Science (Steele, Chandler & Reddy, Springer 2016)

This is more a textbook about data analysis _per se_ rather than a summary of specialized algorithms for statistical computing.

### Foundations of Statistical Algorithms (Weihs, Mersmann & Ligges, CRC Press 2014)

I read this book three or four years ago, and I foudn it interesting for several reasons. First, it includes a Verification chapter which is close to an experimental design of testing, as the authors said.

Second, the chapter on randomization covers

Interestingly, Partial Least Squares is mentioned on several occasions, both from an algorithmic persepctive (chapter 5) and when dealing with model selection in multivariate regression settings. Convex problems like coordinate descent and gradient-based or Quasi-Newton methods are discussed at length in chapter 4.
