Here are two short reviews of books I have read or reread this year.

### Foundations of Statistical Algorithms (Weihs, Mersmann & Ligges, CRC Press 2014)

I read this book three or four years ago, and I found it interesting for several reasons. First, it includes a Verification chapter which is close to an experimental design of testing, as the authors said. Apart from one or two papers about Stata or SAS own verification routines and _Numerical Issues in Statistical Computing for the Social Scientist_, by Altman, Gill and McDonald (Wiley, 2004) that I mentioned in [this post](post/statistical-software-evaluation/), there are few books dedicated to this topic, AFAICT. Here, the authors focus on Linear Least Squares Solvers and the use of [condition numbers](/post/condition-number).

Second, the chapter on randomization covers

Interestingly, Partial Least Squares is mentioned on several occasions, both from an algorithmic persepctive (chapter 5) and when dealing with model selection in multivariate regression settings. Convex problems like coordinate descent and gradient-based or Quasi-Newton methods are discussed at length in chapter 4.

It's quite heavy on math

### Algorithms for Data Science (Steele, Chandler & Reddy, Springer 2016)

This is more a textbook about data analysis _per se_ rather than a summary of specialized algorithms for statistical computing, so I was a bit disappointed at first.
