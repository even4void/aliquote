> Creating and managing a package seemed much harder than I expected. --- [An unbiased evaluation of environment management and packaging tools](https://alpopkes.com/posts/python/packaging_tools/)

... to put it very mildly... This, however, does constitue a very good overview of what's available in the Python ecocystem as of this writing. `#python`<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-08-02</a>: And so, [one year later](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2024/01/the-story-continues-announcing-version-14-of-wolfram-language-and-mathematica/), we got a few dozens of additional functions and a [brand new name](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2024/07/yet-more-new-ideas-and-new-functions-launching-version-14-1-of-wolfram-language-mathematica/).<br>![img](/img/2024-08-02-16-15-50.png)<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-08-06</a>: I wanted to get rid of raw `<img>` tags and replace then with `<figure>`, available as a [shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure) in Hugo. It turned out I had a lot of replacements to perform:

```shell
» rg -nc "\!\[.*\]\(" content/post | cut -d: -f2 | paste -sd+ | bc
688
```

Here's a classical one-liner using Sed:
```shell
sed "s/^\!\[.*\](\(.*\))/{{</* figure src=\"\1\" */>}}/ content/post/*.md
```

I took the opportunity to add a small colored insert to each figure using the following CSS code:
```css
figure {box-shadow: 0 0 0 .5em #f3f3ed;margin: 2em 4em;}
```
<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-08-06</a>: TIL that `\%V` can be used to replace only in a visual selection (very handy for rectangular selection with `<C-V>`). `#vim`<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-08-13</a>: Flat is a good thing but at some point I wish there could be a way to avoid unecessary duplication of core frameworks. I mean, below you'll find that I need 4 versions of the Qt goodies that I don't even use on my system.<br>![img](/img/2024-08-13-21-39-01.png)This all results in several Gig of wasted space, IMO. But this probaby is the way to go, as far as containerization is concerned.

```shell
» du -sh /var/lib/flatpak
11G     /var/lib/flatpak
```

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-08-13</a>: [Someone’s Been Messing With My Subnormals!](https://moyix.blogspot.com/2022/09/someones-been-messing-with-my-subnormals.html): one can only appreciate the obstinacy and quality of the data munging using Python and shell scripting!<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-08-14</a>: Yet another round of computer cleansing today. I also removed VirtualBox since I can certainly manage everything with qemu, and lot of unused Gnome garbage that I installed for testing purpose. Ironically, I also uninstalled [Gapless](micro/2024-07-25-09-44-52/) since I always returned to Cmus with which I am so comfortable and which fits my TUI workflow so perfectly. `#unix`<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-08-15</a>: Just when I spent about half an hour compiling swayimg with all its dependencies, wondering how long it would take to compile the latest version of zathura and zathura-mupdf, it just came up to my mind that Ubuntu 24.04 LTS was released a few months ago. Time to upgrade the whole system I guess. `#vim`<br>

> IRC has historically been one of the most important chat programs in my life. --- [My IRC client runs on Kubernetes](https://xeiaso.net/blog/2024/k8s-irc-client/)Poor or lazy solution on my side: irrsi runs on a uni server, and I rsync the logs on my laptop when I'm in. I also concatenate all channel logs into monthly logs so that it's easier to read what's going on. This is why I may be slow to respond to /msg sometimes.<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-08-24</a>: Some really nice Gnome extensions are landing on GitHub, see [openbar](https://github.com/neuromorph/openbar?tab=readme-ov-file) and [forge](https://github.com/forge-ext/forge). See also [Exploring the Default Tiling Windows Feature in Ubuntu 24.04 (and Enhancing it)](https://itsfoss.com/ubuntu-tiling-windows/).

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-08-24</a>: TIL about [theme.sh](https://github.com/lemnos/theme.sh) which is amazing: no dependency, self-contained, and it can be used online without setting up anything in your bashrc or zshrc config. You can not only preview colorscheme using Fzf, but you can also import your own colorscheme (it will be added in `theme.sh` itself.

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-08-24</a>: Yet another TUI app that I recently added to my toolbet, with the hope that it will improve over time: [tdf](https://github.com/itsjunetime/tdf). I heavily rely on Zathura for things related to PDF (espacially for bidirectional sync when using Texlab), altough I came to appreciate Evince with time (it can open DVI and PS file, by the way). With async rendering and hot reloading, I can imagine that tdf could be a great add-on for previewing $\TeX$ compilation results.<br>
