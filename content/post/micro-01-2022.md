> It’s been my experience that our intuition of what is and isn’t a pathological or malicious input is about as accurate as time estimates. Requirements change and any and all attack vectors will be found and exploited.

> The real enemy addressed by inlining is unexpected dependency and mutation of state, which functional programming solves more directly and completely. However, if you are going to make a lot of state changes, having them all happen inline does have advantages; you should be made constantly aware of the full horror of what you are doing. When it gets to be too much to take, figure out how to factor blocks out into pure functions (and don.t let them slide back into impurity!). --- [John Carmack on Inlined Code](http://number-none.com/blow/john_carmack_on_inlined_code.html)<br>

<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2022-01-11</a>: While browsing GitHub, I noticed that the [nvim-lua](https://github.com/nvim-lua) organization offers a "starter kit" `init.lua` file for Neovim users. It is a single Lua file, which is quite handy when you want to quickly bootstrap a sane config on external servers. I tested it in my own environment and it's pretty good actually. If you are new to Neovim, and especially Lua config files, I recommend taking a look at how this file is organized. Except for a few packages (theme and snippets), and the default key mappings, you will likely find a working setup for your daily editing tasks. I like the idea of having a single file for the whole config, although I can understand why we may want to split our whole config in separate files, which is actually what I do.<br>

> The worst possible way to learn Rust is by vaguely looking at it, or trying some small stuff, in short scattered sessions at night after your demanding work. Sure you did learn a few languages like this before, so you may be confident in your abilities. But at some point in Rust, and it may come soon, you'll encounter a higher step and if you don't fight it with concentration and dedication, you risk not overcome it. --- [How not to learn Rust](https://dystroy.org/blog/how-not-to-learn-rust/)<br>

> Luschny's webpage cites, for example, recent treatments of the subject by leading mathematicians such as Terence Tao. And his most compelling argument, from my personal perspective, is the way he unveils the early publications: I learned from him that my own presentation of the story, in The Art of Computer Programming and much more extensively in Concrete Mathematics, was a violation of history! I had put words and thoughts into Bernoulli and Euler's minds that were not theirs at all. This hurt, because I've always tried to present the evolution of ideas faithfully; in this case I'd fooled myself, by trying to conform what they wrote to what I'd learned.  --- [Concrete Mathematics and Bernoulli](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/news22.html)<br>
