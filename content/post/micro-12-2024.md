<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-12-04</a>: /me is listening to "I Can't Be" by Sally Dige<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-12-04</a>: Musing with three types of backup systems on my old Macbook: Arq, Borg and Kopia. I was able to mount every backup folder correctly. Now I just need to put the years end-to-end!<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-12-21</a>: I got a new MacBook Pro. It's gorgeous!<br>![img](/img/2024-12-21-21.29.20.png)<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-12-21</a>: Tip of the day: To rename a bunch of photos on your HD according to the original date, the following works well: `exiftool '-filename<CreateDate' -d %Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S%%-c.%%le -ext jpg -r .`.<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-12-26</a>: /me is listening to "Flesh Dance" by Gothic Tropic<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2024-12-27</a>: I switched my default mail provider to iCloud, instead of this domain name. Back in time, I guess. This way I can manage my emails using Neomutt or Apple Mail (via IMAP), depending on my mood, and everything keeps sync'ed. I needed to convert my archives folder from Maildir to Mbox but Neomutt failed me when I used the [following command](https://stackoverflow.com/a/78563498):

```shell
neomutt -f ~/.mail/archives -e 'set mbox_type=mbox; set confirmcreate=no; set delete=no; push "T.*<enter>;s/Users/chl/tmp/archives.mbox<enter><quit>"'
```

I believe this doesn't handle multiple aliases for sender correctly. However, this [Python module](https://github.com/bluebird75/maildir2mbox) worked like a charm and I was able to get 10k messages with correct threading in no time at all.<br>
