A little review of my current Safari session since it is probably time to close all those tabs bookmarked on my iPhone.

<!--more-->

I have long been aspiring to some kind of digital minimalism, and I think I am almost there, with my using only essential applications--to write, code, and read--and almost very reliable ones--Vim or Emacs, a Terminal, and macOS builtin and optimized apps. I would have a harder time to live without my bookshelf or my 25-year old collection of records. However, [it seems that we can](https://markmanson.net/minimalism), provided you live like a real bohemian. (I came across this by reading one of Irreal [blog post](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8197) recently.)

I don't use Chrome, and I don't think it is a good idea to use any Google products by now. Facebook is just a little toy compared to the power that Google has accumulated over years. I am using a Mac and I subscribed to Apple Music, though, and you could retort that it's all the same. I don't think so, since it's not the same offer of services, unless you think of Chromebook (or Android) users. Anyway, here is a little joy for Lisp saavy users: [Dinosaur and Lisp](http://vito.sdf.org/dino.html). Note, however, that you will need to have a working Chrome(ium).

I didn't knwo there was such a thing, but here it is: [Tutorial on Good Lisp Programming Style](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~nau/cmsc421/norvig-lisp-style.pdf), by Peter Norvig (PDF, 116 pp.). [The Little Book of Python Anti-Patterns](https://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/index.html) also provides good tips regarding Python this time.

Some CS ressources here and there: [Stanford CS Education Library](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu) (via HN), [The Ultimate Guide to Learning Clojure for Free](https://purelyfunctional.tv/mini-guide/the-ultimate-guide-to-learning-clojure-for-free/); and a particular HT to Greg Wilson for his [Tidynomicon](https://gvwilson.github.io/tidynomicon/) (I don't like the tidyverse but this could people in a hurry, plus there are some interesting tips on interacting with Python or developing web app through Shiny) and, of course, the [JavaScript for Data Science](http://js4ds.org) website.

Some fresh articles for the interested scientific reader:

- [Please Stop Permuting Features: An Explanation and Alternatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03151): An interesting take on why permutation-based statistics may lead to erroneous assessment of model accuracy, especially in the case of strongly correlated predictors;
- [Advances in epigenetics link genetics to the environment and disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1411-0): A great review of epigenetics and its role/implication in biology and health-related research;
- [SciPy 1.0â€”Fundamental Algorithms for Scientific Computing in Python](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10121): Surely a great read for people interested in scientific computing, at least for the historical side and the resulting popularity of Python in data science and computational statistics;
- [Lagged Explanatory Variables and the Estimation of Causal Effect](https://tompepinsky.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jop2017.pdf) (PDF, 15 pp.): In which the uthors used DAGs and Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that lag identification often leads to incorrect inferences;
- [Generalised linear models for prognosis and intervention: Theory, practice, and implications for machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01461): All you need to known about GLM vs. ML for prediction and causal inference, as a complement to Frank Harrell's excellent [past discussion](https://www.fharrell.com/post/stat-ml) of this hot topic.

Do you like quines? How about [making compressed file quines, step by step](https://blog.matthewbarber.io/2019/07/22/how-to-make-compressed-file-quines)? This blog post provides a nice description of how GZIP files are encoded and how they can be manipulated using Python.

[Vim vs Emacs: Detailed Comparison](https://linuxhint.com/vim_vs_emacs/), or the Holy war again. Interesting post, albeit a little too generalist for my taste (thx to Irreal!). On a related side, I happened to read a nice post on the [history of Vim](https://begriffs.com/posts/2019-07-19-history-use-vim.html) recently.

[Program Design by Calculation](http://www4.di.uminho.pt/~jno/ps/pdbc.pdf) is a (draft) textbook all about functional programming, functors and monads, and Haskell:

> Functional programming has a tradition of absorbing fresh results from theoretical computer science, algebra and category theory. Languages such as Haskell have been competing to integrate the most re- cent developments and therefore are excellent prototyping vehicles in courses on program calculation, as happens with this book.

Well, that's all for this month!
