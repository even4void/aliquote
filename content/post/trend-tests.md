A few weeks ago I discussed the [Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test](/post/cochran-mantel-haenszel/). Another widely used test to assess linear trend in two-way tables is the Mantel-Haenszel trend test. There's a very interesting discussion about [trend tests](https://www.stata.com/support/faqs/statistics/test-for-trend/) on Stata FAQs, by William Sribney from StataCorp.
