I think I installed [VS Code] on my laptop one or two years ago. Since then, I never used it, and I found myself updating the application itself and the limited set of extensions I installed alongside for one year long without even touching it. In fact, I was mostly interested in Language Server add-ons, but now that these are quite stabilized features in Neovim, I believe I no longer need to check whether it works as expected (i.e., as it is expected to behave in VS Code)
