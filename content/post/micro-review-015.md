A little bit early, but I wanted to record recent bookmarks from my RSS reader as well as various links stored in my Safari reading list.

- [The Haskell Elephant in the Room](https://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/crypto.html): Another nice article by Stephen Diehl on the current state of the Haskell ecosystem in relation especially to cryptocurrency.

  > Cryptocurrency is not a traditional business in any sense. The basic economic structure of a business is a group of people who exchange their goods or services for money. For example, your traditional software consulting business sells your time and expertise to clients to write software for them. Your ecommerce website provides a marketplace to sell physical goods. Your local coffee shops sells you wifi under the guise of coffee. However cryptocurrency companies do not produce anything, instead they offer synthetic financial products which are marketed to the generic public as investments. These “investments” are not tied directly to economic activity, these are what economists call non-productive assets. The value of these assets is only determined by what other people are willing to pay for them. This has created a giant ecosystem in which products aren’t traded on any investment fundamentals but on the hope to sell them off to a “greater fool”.

- [Number regexes are hard](https://leancrew.com/all-this/2020/07/number-regexes-are-hard/), or how to take into account n-dash and the like when parsing numbers.

- [The Right Dictionary and How to Get It](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=9035): So now, I also have the Webster's dictionary available on my Mac. Be sure to read the companion blog post, [You’re probably using the wrong dictionary](http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary), and don't worry: it will take some time to build the final dictionary as advertised in the blog post.

- We got a few updates the last few weeks: [Highlights from Git 2.28](https://github.blog/2020-07-27-highlights-from-git-2-28/) with Bloom filters, [Racket v7.8](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2020/08/racket-v7-8.html), and [Julia 1.5 Highlights](https://julialang.org/blog/2020/08/julia-1.5-highlights/). It's probably time to switch to Racket on Chez since the next release will default to it, and I definitely need to start hacking on Julia again.

> We aim to improve our ability to engineer artificial intelligence, reverse-engineer natural intelligence, and deploy applications that increase our collective intelligence and well-being.<br>We do this by integrating probabilistic inference, generative models, and Monte Carlo methods into the building blocks of software, hardware, and other computational systems. --- [MIT Probabilistic Computing Project](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu)
