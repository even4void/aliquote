Yet another round of tech review for the past weeks.

Want to get rid of Google services [like me](/post/goodbye-google/), e.g., Google Translate? Take a look at [DeepL translator](https://www.deepl.com/translator). It works like a charm whes it comes to detecting the input language or for translation as far as I can tell.

It looks like Deckset got a [major refactoring](https://www.decksetapp.com/2/) and now support custom themes. I used this app a lot when preparing slides for my lectures or academic prez, and I always felt it was lacking support for custom tables and themes, although the built-in theme were pretty neat. I bought the 1.x version from the App Store back in 2014, so I am not eligible for the free upgrade. To be honest, I thought this app was going to die slowly, but I am happy to be proven wrong.

GitHub is an amazing place, not only for open source projects. Try [making your bookshelf a little more wonderful each week](https://github.com/TechBookHunter) with all those tech books available in PDF format. h/t [@Jose_A_Alonso](https://twitter.com/Jose_A_Alonso/status/994517457405607936)

This monthly newsletter needs some Lisp dereferencing: Here is the [Common Lisp homepage](http://lisp-lang.org).

> I’ve been satisfied with Python for almost 10 years. But I don’t think I’ll still be using it another decade from now. I think I’ll be using Swift.

[Here is why](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/why-data-scientists-should-start-learning-swift-66c3643e0d0d). By the way, the [Swift for TensorFlow project](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift) is already on GitHub.

[Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/), published in 2014 by Cambridge University Press, is available for free. What makes this book different from other books on the same topic?

I was really disappointed by the recent buzz around RMS, but *this* is very well put:
