When switching to i3, as discussed in my [previous post](/post/i3wm/), I was particularly interested in getting a more comfortable keyboard-centric user experience. This led me to drop or look for alternatives to the few Gnome applications I used to use (Evince, Nautilus, Firefox). Below is a quick summary of I've found.


### Nyxt browser

I really like the design philosophy of Nyxt, and you will certainly acknowledge, especially if you have some experience with keyboard-driven or TUI web browser, that the UI is beautiful. Moreover, it is designed with Emacs and Vim users in mind, since you can select the keybindings set you like best.

Several keyboard-driven web browsers, like [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/), [vimb](https://fanglingsu.github.io/vimb/), or [Conkeror](http://conkeror.org/) (which I heard about a few years ago via Technomancy), notwithstanding Firefox plugins that can be used to emulate Vim motions like [Vimperator](http://vimperator.org/vimperator.html) or [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl). I tried Tridactyl a few weeks but I was overall not very satisfied with the way it works. Above all, the only features I really want is that infamous easy motion selector (which usually goes by the shortcut F or f) and a quick search bar using /. Firefox native search tools are not really helpful: <kbd>Ctrl+F</kbd> open a small dialog box at the bottom of the page, and it is hard to close without using the mouse once you start navigating around matched words in the HTML page. And there's a quick lookup function available via <kbd>/</kbd> but I never understood how it really works.
