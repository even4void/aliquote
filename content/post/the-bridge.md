I just finished watching The Bridge (1st season) last week. This is a great series.

After *Top of the Lake* (season 1 and 2) and *Jordskott*, I decided to stay on the same line and try another Swedish/Danish series. I must say I don't regret it, even if it is hard to beat Top of the Lake. If you don't know that TV show, go watch it right now, you won't regret it. the main female character is captivating in her role as a policewoman suffering from Asperger syndrome, and her Danish colleague plays just as well in this thriller in 10 episodes. You will have to wait for episode 9 for the final outcome (in two acts).
