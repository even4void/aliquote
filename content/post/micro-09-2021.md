<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2021-09-06</a>: As a consequence of switching to i3wm, my RAM usage dropped down to 550 Mo (instead of 950 Mo) when idle with only one terminal (Kitty). However, since I'm using i3+tmux+kitty+vim keybindings have become a thing, really: Shift+Ctrl for Kitty, C-b (and alt for navigating windows) for tmux, Win key for i3!<br>
<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2021-09-06</a>: Trying out i3 as a replacement for the default Gnome window manager, which is fine but I was looking for a more handy keyboard-driven app switcher and window management. As far as I can tell, Pop OS! looks really great, but i3 is simpler to install and to configure.<br>

> For the past 30+ years in the industry (and generally in society) I have seen nothing more stupid and absolutely devastating than people following hype, trends and "majority" rule. Not only that, but the worst part is, and that is something that is really difficult to handle, when those very people actually believe that what they are doing is the right thing.

> I don’t consider myself a beginner to Unix or computers (I even have a PhD in the damn things), but I do consider myself a fairly inept and inexperienced systems administrator, with no great desire to spend the time to become better, and my needs are fairly basic - just the usual web/shell/IRC/mail server stuff, and other random infrastructure needs that come along for my work.
