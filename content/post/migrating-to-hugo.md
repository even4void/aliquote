Last day, I decided to embrace modern web technologies by switching to Hugo in order to manage my website in a more elegant manner. Up to now, I have been using a mix of Markdown and HTML files

This was also a good opportunity to revise some content and check internal links.
Anyway, it has been a funny experience to edit very old posts and re-read old setups, like a [Macbook Air]({{< ref "post/welcome-to-the-macbook-air.md" >}}), [OS X Lion]({{< ref "post/my-setup.md" >}}), a Macbook Pro, or more recently [High Sierra]({{< ref "post/setup-2018.md" >}})

- I had to download and unfill pictures and images from Dropbox
- Several posts must be converted from Textile to Markdown


<i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o fa-1x"></i> indicates a link pointing to a PDF file while <i class="fa fa-file-code-o fa-1x"></i> means a text file with some code

As you may expect, the symbol <i class="fa fa-chain-broken fa-1x"></i> means a broken link or lost ressources.

I usually put <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-1x"></i> at the beginning of an item in a long list of ressources, as in my monthly "tech review".
