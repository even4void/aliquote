CleanMyMac is the app you need if you want to stay organized with your Mac.

I have always been a bit reluctant with "magic cleaner" of any kind. First, it is hard to tell what they really do and it is often easier to let the system automatically cleanup things as it is supposed to be done, and oftentimes those apps do not offer much more than what is presently available in a Terminal (`sudo purge` to reclaim unused RAM, `sudo periodic daily weekly monthly` to remove temporary caches and files, etc.).

CleanMyMac includes several components. The main task is probably to analyze the whole system in order to delete unused files

However, there is also an uninstall tool that I find very useful since it also delete auxiliary files

The latest release (serie X) even features a nice utility: it is now possible to update all apps from the dashboard, even apps that were not installed via the App Store. Overall, I found that it is one of the best addition to the software. Note that this does not include third-app additional packages like Python, R or TexLive.
