Here is a brief overview of the web sharing/syncing solutions I am actually using. Although I hold a Mac account with an iDisk allowing to store remotely my synced files, I found it somewhat slow (especially during upload). Moreover, it does not offer support for cloud computing with live documents, like e.g. [Box.net][Box.net]. But this one is very expensive if you want to get decent capabilities (check for yourself on their website).

Now, what's about other options? 

- [Dropbox][Dropbox] is a must-have application, especially if you need to share some files with specific collaborators and keep trace of any changes related to those files;
- [CloudApp][CloudApp] allows to share images, links, music, etc.: it's like a remote iTunes/iPhoto and as such includes so-called Raindrops which are small sync service with common multimedia applications on the Mac;
- [Syncplicity][Syncplicity] is an alternative to [iWork.com][iWork.com] and can be linked to your Google docs;
- [Evernote][Evernote] is a versatile note editor, allowing to sync images or text (and even audio recording) between your iPhone, your on-line web interface and your Mac.

Most of them are available on iPhone too.

I discovered Dropbox at the beginning of 2009, and used it a lot since then. The latest beta version (available on the [experimental forum build][experimental forum build]) offers several improvements, including selective syncing and getting a shareable link for any of your folder (and not only the `Public` folder). I am waiting for the release of [Elements][Elements] which promises another great enhancement to Dropbox.


I also discovered [Dropzone][Dropzone] which is an application/script launcher sitting in the Dock. It offers useful shortcuts like URL shortening through [bit.ly][bit.ly], upload to your Fickr account, sharing snippets (gist) on Github, etc.
