As I'm (temporarily) tired of reviewing the intertubes and posting more or less interesting links on this blog, I decided to focus on Lisp/Racket and statistical programming until the end of the year at least. Ideally, I would like to translate some of the APSTAT algorithms in Scheme, write some bindings for the Apache [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) library for Racket, use Racket [sketching](https://github.com/soegaard/sketching) or CL [sketch](https://github.com/vydd/sketch) for data visualization, and explore all related packages for data processing in Racket. Stay tuned!

I'm done with [Homeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_(TV_series)) Season 6. Not sure to go on with the next seasons, and I didn't find anything really exciting to fill my evenings. I guess I might as well read the pile of books waiting for me. I listen to music (thanks to [Cmus](/post/cmus/)) and Bandcamp almost all day since two weeks, and it's been great.
