You landed on my homepage, thanks for stopping by! 

I'm an anonymous internet user, also a middle-aged bohemian scientist. This is my little placeholder for random musings in the digital era. I read a lot of [technical stuff](/tags/review) ([raw archive](/files/references.bib) as a BibTeX file) and more generally [literature artwork](/files/books.txt), and I like [writing](/post) about almost everything that is barely related to a computer, or just post [micro ideas](/micro/). Here is [how I (generally) do](/articles/how-i-do). I also happened to be a [teacher](/teaching) when time allowed, and a scientist the remaining of the week. Professional details were once available on a "publish-or-perish" page. Since it is now *defunct*, there only remains the [brief and trusty one-page resume](/files/cv-chlalanne.pdf). But let that not stop you reading more.
