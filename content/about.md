You landed on my homepage, thanks for stopping by!

I'm a middle-aged bohemian scientist, initially trained in cognitive science before working as a medical statistician for nearly a decade. I also happened to be a teacher for 15 years when time allowed, while pretending to be an applied statistician the rest of the week. Professional details were once available on a "publish-or-perish" page, which is no longer up to date. But let that not stop you reading more.

I'm now more or less involved in computer science (bioinformatics, sysadmin, database management) and statistical genetics. Even if I find myself a bit broke, the job is more rewarding and that gives me some free time. Anyway, welcome to my little placeholder for random musings in the digital era! I read a lot of technical stuff ([raw archive](/files/references.bib) as a BibTeX file) and more generally [literature artwork](/files/books.txt) (relaunched in 2013), and I like [writing](/post) about almost everything that is barely related to a computer, or just post [micro ideas](/micro/). Here is [how I (generally) do](/articles/how-i-do). You can reach me on [Libera.chat](/contact).
