You landed on my homepage, thanks for stopping by!

I'm a middle-aged bohemian scientist, initially trained in cognitive science and behavioral statistics before working as a medical statistician for nearly a decade. I also happened to be a teacher (biostatistics as a specialty) for 15 years when time allowed. Professional details were once available on a "publish-or-perish" page, which is no longer up to date. But let that not stop you reading more.

I'm now more or less involved in data processing (bioinformatics, sysadmin, database management, web dev). Even if I find myself a bit broke, the job is more rewarding and that gives me some free time.

Anyway, welcome to my little placeholder for random musings in the digital era! I read a lot of technical stuff ([raw archive](/files/references.bib) as a BibTeX file), listen to a good deal of music every day, and more generally enjoy [literature artwork](/files/books.txt) (relaunched in 2013). I also like [writing](/post) about almost everything that is barely related to a computer, or just post [micro ideas](/micro/). Here is [how I (generally) do](/articles/how-i-do). You can reach me on [Libera.chat](/contact).
