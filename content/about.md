You landed on my homepage, thanks for stopping by!

I'm a middle-aged bohemian scientist, initially trained in cognitive science before working as a medical statistician for around 10 years. Now I'm sort of playing with my computer for a living; it seems like a good deal after all, even if I find myself a bit broke, but the job is much more rewarding. Anyway, welcome to my little placeholder for random musings in the digital era! I read a lot of [technical stuff](/tags/review) ([raw archive](/files/references.bib) as a BibTeX file) and more generally [literature artwork](/files/books.txt) (although I lost track of it), and I like [writing](/post) about almost everything that is barely related to a computer, or just post [micro ideas](/micro/). Here is [how I (generally) do](/articles/how-i-do). I also happened to be a teacher for 15 years when time allowed, while pretending to be an applied statistician the rest of the week. Professional details were once available on a "publish-or-perish" page. There's a [now](/now) page instead. But let that not stop you reading more.
