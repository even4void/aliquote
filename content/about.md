You landed on my homepage. I'm Christophe Lalanne. This is my little placeholder for random musings in the digital era. I read a lot of [technical stuff](/tags/review) and more generally [literature artwork](/files/books.txt), and I like [writing](/post) about almost everything that is barely related to a computer. Professional details were once available on a "publish-or-perish" page. Since it is now *defunct*, there only remains the [brief and trusty one-page resume](/files/cv-chlalanne.pdf). But let that not stop you reading more.
