Here is a list of TV shows I watched over the past few years, along with personal ratings.

I haven't watched TV in about ten years, probably even before I removed the TV from my room. I didn't really like series until I avidly watched 24 every week for many weeks. Since then I occasionally watch TV series, alone or with my son, on Apple Tv or Netflix.
