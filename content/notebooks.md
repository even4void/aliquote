Various notebooks, mostly dealing with statistical data analysis and numerical computing. Most of the time, handouts are available both in HTML and PDF format. Just replace the extension in your web browser by the desired output (e.g., `lang-r-base.html` becomes `lang-r-base.pdf`). All handouts were produced using Org mode and a [personal setup](org-setup.html).

1. Introduction to [R base](lang-r-base.html) and [ggplot2](lang-r-ggplot.html)
2. How to stop worrying about the alembicated "tidy" way to [do simple things in R](wip) [wip]
