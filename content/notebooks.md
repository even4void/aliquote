Various notebooks, mostly dealing with statistical data analysis and numerical computing. Handouts marked with a dagger (†) are available both in HTML and PDF format. Just replace the extension in your web browser by the desired output (e.g., `lang-r-base.html` becomes `lang-r-base.pdf`). All handouts were produced using Org mode and a [personal setup](org-setup.pdf).

1. Introduction to [R base](lang-r-base.html)<sup>†</sup> and [ggplot2](lang-r-ggplot.html)<sup>†</sup>
2. How to stop worrying about the alembicated "tidy" way to [do simple things in R](wip) [wip]
