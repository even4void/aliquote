If you don't have anything to sell, or don't want me to put any form of ads on this site, you can reach me by email: even4void (AT) this domain name. I usually answer fairly quickly; if not, the response time might become unpredictable.

I'm no longer really active on the StackExchange network, I deleted my Twitter, Discord, Twitch, HN, reddit and LinkedIn accounts, and I don't plan to subscribe to any social networks in the future.

You can occasionally find me on IRC, as [even4void](irc://irc.libera.chat/even4void,isnick) on Libera.chat. Please note that I do not use a bouncer and I no longer let Irssi run in a Tmux session on a remote server, so there may be some delay between your /msg and my reply. If I'm not online, send me an email so we can arrange a chat.
