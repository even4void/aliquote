If you don't have anything to sell, or don't want me to put any form of ads on this site, you can reach me by email: even4void (AT) this domain name. I usually answer fairly quickly but if not the response time might become unpredictable. Apparently, the only other place where you can find me is now IRC, as [even4void](irc://irc.libera.chat/even4void,isnick) on Libera.chat, or Matrix via the [same nick](https://matrix.to/#/@meven4void:matrix.org).

I'm no longer really active on the StackExchange network, I don't really like Discord, I deleted my Twitter and LinkedIn account, and I don't plan to subscribe to any social networks in the future.
