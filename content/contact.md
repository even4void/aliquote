If you don't have anything to sell, or don't want me to put any form of ads on this site, you can reach me by email: even4void (AT) this domain name. I usually answer fairly quickly but if not the response time might become unpredictable. Other places where you can find me: IRC, as [even4void](irc://irc.libera.chat/even4void,isnick) on [Libera.chat](https://libera.chat/), and Matrix, as [even4void](https://matrix.to/#/@even4void:matrix.org) again. The same nickname is used to hang around on Discord on an occasional basis.

I'm no longer really active on Twitter, the StackExchange network, Reddit, and I don't plan to subscribe to any social networks in the future.
