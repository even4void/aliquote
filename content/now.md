I stopped posting or bookmarking on Twitter, became a ghost in the machine, and left behind everything I'd built. That's almost all of the story for [now](https://nownownow.com/about).

The previous entry was from 3 months ago, not very close to what is expected from a news page. At least that's how it is. I'm back to work, somehow, but the last two months have been pretty rough in terms of work efficiency and overall motivation. This is not like I never worked remotely: I've done this for years beforehand. It's more about the ups and downs I've been used to for the last four years.

Among the books I recently read, I particularly liked _L'autre moiti√© du songe m'appartient_ (Alicia Gallienne, Gallimard) and _Le monde d'hier_ (Stephen Zweig, Folio).
