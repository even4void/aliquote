This domain is mine and I host my own content. I even stopped posting or bookmarking on Twitter, and became a ghost, almost everywhere as a matter of fact. That's almost all of the story for [now](https://nownownow.com/about).

I am learning about (fungi) genetics while trying to improve my bioinformatics skills. At a paceful rate, of course. After 10 years of medical statistics, it quite hurts but I like the idea. It's good that I can exploit my technical knowledge in a new domain, while being supported by good scientists. In a nutshell, back to the lab after 15 years in roaming mode.

Top activities of the moment:

- Reading as much as I can, like I was doing when I was 20; most importantly, I am currently re-reading several of the old books I used to like a lot. Recently: Fran√ßoise Sagan and Marguerite Duras.
- Improving the design of this site and publishing good posts as often as I can; I've always been writing, so this is just kind of a new way to express myself.
- Learning new stuff. Currently: Population genetics and phylogenetic tree reconstruction.
