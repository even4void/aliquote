I left behind everything I'd built, and now I sometimes feels like a ghost in the machine. That's almost all of the story for [now](https://nownownow.com/about).

I haven't updated this page in a while, again. It was well worth creating one. Anyway, I spent the entire last month in total confinement, with the exception of one or two outings of less than 2 hours per week. That was quite a month.

I'm starting a new adventure in the Linux land, this time with Ubuntu 20.06 LTS and a new laptop. Almost nothing new to me: I know a bit of Linux, from my old times in university, and I keep using a terminal and Neovim for most of my daily work. The hardest part is getting used to the non-Mac keyboard. After three days of intense labor, I now have a perfect working installation with all the tools I need.
