*I left behind everything I'd built, and now I sometimes feels like a ghost in the machine. That's almost all of the story for [now](https://nownownow.com/about).*

Last week before going back to work...

Overall, the Summer was pretty nice: no heat wave period as in previous years, a few days in the countryside, a lot of books reads, and long days spent to listen to chill jazz. I'm currently reading J'Ã©cris ton nom, by Sylvestre Sbille, and I'm still into this sweet [Jazz Chill](/micro/2019-03-25-20-08-00/) compilation grabbed on Apple Music. I'm done with Season 2 of [Homeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_(TV_series)), and I don't know what's next. Now, I'm trying to dive deeper into Haskell and Mathematica.
