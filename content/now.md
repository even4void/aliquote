I stopped posting or bookmarking on Twitter, and became a ghost, almost everywhere as a matter of fact. That's almost all of the story for [now](https://nownownow.com/about).

I am (still) learning about fungi genetics while trying to improve my bioinformatics skills. At a paceful rate, of course. After 10 years of medical statistics, it quite hurts but I like the idea. It's good that I can exploit my technical knowledge in a new domain, while being supported by good scientists. In a nutshell, back to the lab after 15 years in roaming mode.

Top activities of the moment:

- Recent [reads](/files/books.txt) include Georges Perec, Rimbaud but I am still re-reading several of the old books I used to like a lot when I was 20.
- No more design stuff for the website: I like it as it is (I may add a dark mode at some point). I shall concentrate on adding new content more or less regularly.
- Diving into population genetics and bayesian phylogenetic tree reconstruction.
- Cooking.
