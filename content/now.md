I left behind everything I'd built, and now I sometimes feels like a ghost in the machine. That's almost all of the story for [now](https://nownownow.com/about).

This time I'm only a month and a half late to update this page. I'm on holidays, 15 days remaining or something like that. It has been very hot recently, but now the wether is milder. The health crisis doesn't affect me that much since I haven't seen anyone but my family for about 20 months now. It remains to be seen how this will play out in the new school year and whether I'll continue to work from. At least, I could get back to work and be more productive in June.

I also spend a lot of time reconfiguring my whole command-line oriented setup ([Zsh](/post/customizing-iterm2/) and [Emacs](/post/emacs-in-terminal/)), and I'm happy with the results. I can now spend a whole day just in my terminal, with a few round trips on Safari. And finally, I'm starting to get a taste for statistical analysis again, but I don't know how long it will last.

I read about 30 books in the last two months. A lot of them were interesting, or at least entertaining, see the last entries in my [book list](https://aliquote.org/files/books.txt).
