This domain is mine and I host my own content. I even stopped posting or bookmarking on Twitter, and became a ghost, almost everywhere as a matter of fact. That's almost all of the story for [now](https://nownownow.com/about).

I'm slowly recovering from a stroke that most people don't care about and that I keep to myself. Not a big deal, it was nevertheless a good opportunity to learn about the human race in recent years. However, I try not to forget about joy --- even if life seems to no longer really belong to me sometimes --- by spending all the time I can with my son, as I did in the past. And nothing else matters.

I am learning about (fungi) genetics while trying to improve my bioinformatics skills. At a paceful rate, of course. After 10 years of medical statistics, it quite hurts but I like the idea. It's good that I can exploit my technical knowledge in a new domain, while being supported by good scientists. In a nutshell, back to the lab after 15 years of roaming.

Top activities of the moment:

- Reading as much as I can, like I was doing when I was 20; most importantly, I am currently re-reading several of the old books I used to like a lot (currently: Ana√Øs Nin, Vladimir Nabokov, Milan Kundera, Paul Eluard).
- Improving the design of this site and publishing good posts as often as I can; I've always been writing, so this is just kind of a new way to express myself.
- Learning new skills (see above); not a big deal either, as I've always been eager to learn new things.
- Aside beers in the evening, taking care of my food and physical condition; forget about my mood and emotional states, they are too varying.
