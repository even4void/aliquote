Last journey was "chez Cathy". I haven't travelled in a while, so it was pretty cool to move from home. I was also a full week off, which is great after all.

I was reading _sept gingembres_ (Christophe Perruchas) lately. Rather relaxing, not more. Bug I liked it.

Happy to see my RSS feed list growing up (250 -> 480), Twitter is so depressing these days.
