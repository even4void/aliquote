I stopped posting or bookmarking on Twitter, and became a ghost, almost everywhere as a matter of fact. That's almost all of the story for [now](https://nownownow.com/about).

I am (still) diving into bioinformatics using Python and whatever nifty command-line tools I can find to perform {D|R}NA mapping, genome assembly and phylogenetic tree reconstruction using bayesian approaches. At a paceful rate, of course. Medical statistics are way behind but I'm keeping an eye out.

Top activities of the moment:

- Recent [reads](/files/books.txt) include lot of stuff, because I'm working at home and Twitter is too depressing these days.
- Still learning about population genetics and bayesian phylogenetic tree reconstruction. Also Graph theory, Django, Docker, H2O, and modern C.
- Enjoying Lisp and Scheme more and more. Yet a lot to learn.
- 53 days uptime, mostly Emacs and a web browser, thousands of micro-posts --- Macbook 12â€³ from 2016 still alive.

- Cooking (unchanged).
