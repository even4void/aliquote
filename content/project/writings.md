## Textbooks

### Biostatistique et analyse informatique des données de santé avec R et Stata

<i class="fa fa-github fa-1x"></i> [biostatsante](https://github.com/biostatsante)

There are French and English versions for two textbooks on applied biostatistics (Master level) using [R](https://iste-editions.fr/products/biostatistique-et-analyse-informatique-des-donnees-de-sante-avec-r) or [Stata](https://iste-editions.fr/products/biostatistique-et-analyse-informatique-des-donnees-de-sante-avec-stata) available on Iste Editions (ebook or paperback). The companion website includes datasets and R or Stata code.

### From SAS to R in clinical research
<i class="fa fa-github fa-1x"></i> [chlalanne/SAS2R](https://github.com/chlalanne/SAS2R)

A draft textbook I started working on back in 2016, when I was reading some books from SAS Publishing. No idea if it will be finished any soon.


### R Companion to Design and Analysis of Experiments
<i class="fa fa-github fa-1x"></i> [chlalanne/dae-textbook](https://github.com/chlalanne/dae-textbook)

A very old attempt at adapting SAS and Design Expert code for this great book written by [Douglas C. Montgomery](http://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&itemId=047148735X&bcsId=2172). Chapters 1 to 6 (partly) were once completed using R 2.x but there would still be a lot to do to make it useable in a classroom.
