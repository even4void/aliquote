Here is a list of things I like to work on when time allows. As you will guess pretty quickly, I can leave _those_ things hanging out for years, but there is always a chance that this stuff will be finished someday. Note that these pages are a resurrection of my [previous website](/post/migrating-to-hugo/), and I left a lot of materials behind.

If you are looking for my old teaching ressources, almost everything should be on the Teaching page if you bookmarked it once in a while.

## Current work (so called [wip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_in_process))

I yet have to find something to write, you know something that will last forever -- but never ending. In the meantime, check my Github in case you find something of potential interest.
