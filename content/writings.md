Here is a list of things I like to work on when time allows. As you will guess pretty quickly, I can leave _those_ things hanging out for years, but there is always a chance that this stuff will be finished someday. Note that these pages are a resurrection of my [previous website](/post/migrating-to-hugo/), and I left a lot of materials behind.

If you are looking for my old teaching ressources, almost everything should be on the Teaching page if you bookmarked it once in a while, and for the glory stuff, I mean the "publication" page, it might pop up at random time.

## Current work (so called [WIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_in_process))

I yet have to find something to write, you know something that will last forever -- but never ending.

## Past work (also called mostly [defunct](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/defunct))

(I mean, don't expect any check from me.)
