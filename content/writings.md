Here is a list of things I like to work on when time allows. As you will guess pretty quickly, I can leave *those* things hanging out for years, but there is always a chance that this stuff will be finished someday. Note that these pages are a resurrection of my previous website, and I left a lot of materials behind. 

If you are looking for my old teaching ressources, almost everything should be on the [Teaching page](/teaching).
