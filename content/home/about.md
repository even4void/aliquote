You landed on my homepage. Welcome! This is my little placeholder for random musings in the digital era. Professional details were once available on a "publish-or-perish" page. Since it is now *defunct*, there only remains the <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o fa-1x"></i> {{% staticref "files/cv-chlalanne.pdf" %}}brief and trusty one-page resume{{% /staticref %}}. But let that not stop you reading more.
