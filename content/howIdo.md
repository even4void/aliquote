_How do I build this site_
: I like speed so I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and a modified version of the [Ezhil theme](/post/site-redesign/). A lot of cool guys are using the Academic theme, but I don't like to do like everyone (the same applies when using default Beamer templates), and it doesn't look that pretty, IMHO. Previously, I was editing the site using custom handcrafted <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> files. That was painful but I kept everything under control. Sometimes I even respected the established standards. Now this is all about HTML5, CSS3, SASS, FontAwesome, etc. I am getting older and I have less time to play with new technologies. This is it. The old site is dead. Long live the new site!

_What editor do I use_
: I'm using [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) for all things related to text editing. I've been using [Doom](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) Emacs for two years or so. Previously I tried Spacemacs, after like 15 years using Vanilla Emacs. I've tried other text editors in the past but I was always missing some of Emacs or Vim functionalities. Textmate was so great, but it doesn't run in a Terminal and is Mac only. I choose Emacs over Vi long ago, and I was happy with that until I realized how nice Vim is. Don't get me wrong: it's not about being part of the evil vs. God proponents war. I don't have a religion (even if you bring me some data). I used to use Vim over ssh or for small offhand editing tasks. Lately I realized I could handle all things I was doing with Emacs with Neovim, without having to break my config every two weeks because of package updates and broken dependencies in Doom or other starter kits. Of course, I could rewrite my Emacs config from scratch, but I am lazy nowadays. Let's go full-time Neovim for now.

_What software do I use_
: Over the years, I have installed and used (or forget to use) many Mac apps until I realized that some were just not matching the way I work. No need to try again and again. Everyone has his own GTD---whether it works or not is another matter---and there is simply no point trying to do like the others. I've been using Macbooks during 15 years. Lately, I tended to stick with few apps on my 12â€³ Macbook, and I provided [some review](/categories/app-review) of various apps I may have used from time to time. Many of those fancy apps were uninstalled at some point, as I realized that nothing was going to replace my Terminal and command-line utilities. Recently, I switched to [Ubuntu](/post/welcome-ubuntu/) and I no longer use macOS for my daily job. I also use [OpenBSD](/post/welcome-openbsd/) from time to time. In both cases, the usual suspects are the same: Neovim, Tmux and Zsh, as the basis of all of my workflows, additional TUIs for reading mail ([neomutt](https://neomutt.org/)), reading news ([newsboat](https://newsboat.org/)), listening to music ([cmus](https://cmus.github.io/) or [mpv](https://mpv.io/)), or chatting on Libera.chat ([irssi](https://irssi.org/)). I'm definitely back to the future.

_Why open source and closed software_
: I spent almost 15 years using the R statistical package, although I also happen to use Stata or Mathematica. Is it worth a debate? I like open source software and I use a lot of them on a daily basis, but I may also buy good software if they do the job and I feel comfortable using them. If you swear by R, please take a(nother) look at [Stata documentation](https://www.stata-press.com/manuals/documentation-set/). If you say there is nothing better than running SymPy in a Jupyter notebook, try Mathematica.

_What is my preferred programming language_
: I like C (well, that was years ago!), Common Lisp and Scheme dialects, and sometimes Python. These days, I am mostly diving into Racket, Haskell, Clojure, and I use shell scripting, SQL and Python at work. Usually, being able (1) to fire an REPL for quick scripting, (2) to use efficient data structures and/or <abbr title="Foreign Function Interface">FFI</abbr> and (3) to rely on good visualization backends are a plus. After all, this is usually what we expect for [statistical computing and data science](https://darrenjw.wordpress.com/2013/12/23/scala-as-a-platform-for-statistical-computing-and-data-science/). Above all, I make heavy use of a terminal (previously, iTerm2 and [Fish](/post/fish-shell); next, [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) and zsh; now, Tmux in a Gnome Terminal and zsh) and text-oriented tools (sed/awk, GNU [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/)).

_Where do I find all those informations on the www_
: I used to consult my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/chlalanne) two or three times a day, and spent a lot of time on [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/) for some years. Now my relation with internet is close to nil, except perhaps for brief chat session on IRC and regular checks of my RSS feeds. I also read some articles on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org); I still follow some cool and bright people on the internet, especially their blog or GitHub accounts. See if you find something interesting to read from my [OPML file](/files/chl.opml). Want some names? Here we go (in no particular order): [Evan Miller](http://www.evanmiller.org), [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.org), [John D Cook](https://www.johndcook.com/), [Atabey Kaygun](https://kaygun.tumblr.com), [John Myles White](http://www.johnmyleswhite.com), [Darren Wilkinson](https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/d.j.wilkinson/), [Dirk Eddelbuetel](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com), [Peter Ellis](http://freerangestats.info), [Jan de Leeuw](http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu), [Frank Harrell](http://www.fharrell.com), [Will Lowe](https://conjugateprior.org/), [Seth Brown](http://www.drbunsen.org), [Ben Klemens](https://modelingwithdata.org), [Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/), [Radford Neal](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~radford/), [Jeffrey M Heer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/), [Peter Norvig](http://www.norvig.com), [Allen Downey](http://www.allendowney.com/wp/), [Jack Baty](http://baty.net), [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com), [Eli Bendersky](https://eli.thegreenplace.net), [BSAG](https://www.rousette.org.uk), [Steve Losh](http://stevelosh.com), [Robert Smith](http://www.stylewarning.com/blog/). I also recommend [strager](https://www.twitch.tv/strager) and [togglebit](https://www.twitch.tv/togglebit) Twitch channels. And, of course, a big thanks to [Christophe Pallier](http://www.pallier.org)!

_Is there a photo of me somewhere_
: N/A (not anymore). Unless you're looking for my Gravatar, which actually is an old drawing of my son when he was 4 years old.
