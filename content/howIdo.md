## How do I... (but not why)

**How do I build this site**
: I like speed so I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and a modified version of the [even theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-even/). A lot of cool guys are using the Academic theme, but I don't like to do like everyone (the same applies when using default Beamer templates), and it doesn't look that pretty, IMHO. Previously, I was editing the site using custom handcrafted <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> files. That was painful but I kept everything under control. Now this is all about HTML5, CSS3, SASS, FontAwesome, etc. I am getting older and I have less time to play with new technologies. This is it. The old site is dead. Long live the new site!

**What editor do I use**
: I use mostly vanilla Emacs or a frameworked version (e.g., [Spacemacs](https://spacemacs.org), [Doom](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs)). I've tried other text editors in the past but I was always missing some of Emacs or Vi functionalities. I choose Emacs over Vi long ago, and I am happy with that. Don't reagrd this as my minor contribution to the continuing war between evil and God proponents. I don't have a religion (even if you bring me some data).

**What software do I use**
: Over the years, I have installed and used (or forget to use) many Mac apps until I realized that some were just not matching the way I work. No need to try again and again. Everyone has his own GTD---whether it works or not is another matter---and there is simply no point trying to do like the others. These days, I tend to stick with few apps on my 12â€³ Macbook, and I provide [some review](/categories/app-review) from time to time.

**Why open source and closed software**
: I spent almost 15 years using the R statistical package, although I may also happen to use Stata or Mathematica. Is it worth a debate? I like open source software and I use a lot of them on a daily basis, but I may also buy good software if they do the job and I feel comfortable using them. If you swear by R, please take a(nother) look at [Stata documentation](https://www.stata-press.com/manuals/documentation-set/). If you say there is nothing better than running SymPy in a Jupyter notebook, try Mathematica.

**What is my preferred programming language**
: I like C, Common Lisp and Python. These days, I am mostly diving into Clojure, Racket and Swift, with a bit of Javascript and Rust. Usually, being able (1) to fire an REPL for quick scripting, (2) to use efficient data structures and/or <abbr title="Foreign Function Interface">FFI</abbr> and (3) to rely on good visualization backends are a plus. After all, this is usually what we expect for [statistical computing and data science](https://darrenjw.wordpress.com/2013/12/23/scala-as-a-platform-for-statistical-computing-and-data-science/).

**Where do I find all those informations on the www**
: I consult my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/chlalanne) two or three times a day; I read some articles on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org); I follow some cool and bright people on the internet (here is an [OPML](/files/chl.opml) file for your RSS reader if you like), especially their blog or GitHub accounts.

**Is there a photo of me somewhere**
: Sure. Here you are!
