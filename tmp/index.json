proposed including starterkithttpsgithubcomtechnomancyemacsstarterkit preludehttpsgithubcombbatsovprelude and various flavours based on those packaging systems eg Eric Schultes Starter Kit for Emacs

defaultssince Emacs is what it is and you are free to customize it the way you like After all Emacs default configuration is already a good one compared to many other free Text editor and yes I know Emacs is not just a Text editor Ive tried two Starter Kits and preludehttpsgithubcombbatsovprelude but 1 nothing works right out of the box and 2 I dislike using preconfigured packages because I know I will spend more time tweaking their many options than writing a set of configuration files myself This is not to say that these are bad frameworks They are just bad for me because I know I will learn nothing from copying them into my emacs directory or I will spend too much time parsing hundreds of Elisp files Moreover there are many Emacs modes that I dont need basically I mainly work with R Python lisp Markdown and shell and other settings I am not used to when it comes to handle text stream in Emacs However I very much appreciate the work made by othersespecially the litterate programming approach based on orgmode by Eric Schulte and I must acknowledge I shamelessly copypaste many of Elisp instructions in my own emacs for years Now I was just feeling it really is time to build my own set of configuration files Here is how looks my Emacs at the time I am writing this post with Gruber themehttpsgithubcomreximgruberdarkertheme with an R script and an

this Emacs config files on GitHub alert A modular approach to package management In a related post I described how I configured my new MacBook Pro by using Homebrewhttpbrewsh This took me half a day before a trip to Utrecht It took me a couple of hours to build a whole directory of Elisp files to manage my final Emacs configuration Lets start by taking a look at what is finally included in my emacsd directory tree d L 1 autosavelist cache elpa modules snippets var vendor 7 directories ls README cache initel snippets vendor autosavelist elpa modules var The initel file is quite simple it consists in initializing Emacs package manager define a series of required packages1 if they are not installed they will be installed when Emacs starts and some specific directories and finally launch

languages and I make heavy use of Eldoc Outline and Idosmex All temporary or history files are saved in the cache directory which avoids to clutter my user directory or the emacsd folder itself Although I do not use betterdefaultshttpsgithubcomtechnomancybetterdefaults I think I setup almost everything as suggested by Phil Hagelberg I do not make use of Yassnippet but it is required by Python elpyhttpsgithubcomjorgenschaeferelpy At some point I will probably remove this dependance Im quite happy with how things are working now Regarding Lisp dialects Common Lisp Clojure and Scheme I have the following settings mylispelhttpsaliquoteorgpubmylispel and myschemehttpsaliquoteorgpubmyschemeel Note that I configured Slime in both cases ie with SBCL and with Chicken Scheme Finally as can be noted in one of the first output above I still have to manage how to put this autosavelist folder into the right place cache but thats a minor issue At some point I should probably give Helmhttptuhdogithubiohelmintrohtml a try However I do not really like when theres too much fuzzy completion As long as I can keep it simple and have access to my favorite commands within few keystrokes Im happy with my current configuration Sidenote I was thinking I could organize R packages into two different folders core where most used and reliable packages would go and sandbox where I would copy packages that I barely use or that I just installed to check some functions This bears some idea from devtoolsdevmode except that all packages will be listed under libPath and thus available at any time However this would greatly simply their updating since I could just list the core packages in a separate text file that I could pass to installpackages when I need to update only those packages or for a brand new installation of R 1 Actually for testing purpose I also installed some packages by hand Mx listpackagesinstall and I added them back to my list of default packages This is why using a simple text file with the name of packages would be a better alternative"},{"title":"Academic Teaching","tags":["statistics"],"href":"/academic-teaching","content":"Yesterday was

access to contacts stored in the Address Book I havent found any iCal support although there seems to be some Apple scripts located in MailMateappContentsSharedSupportScripts Not sure of what to do with them at the moment Since Gmail does not follow usual IMAP convention we always end up with duplicated messages in our mailbox unless we adapt the way messages are fetched on the server On Apple

makes it comfortable even without a mouse Import facilities including eml for those who like Outlook and mbox format Natural Markdown support I only use plain text but it might be useful from time to time if syntax highlighting for code snippets is needed Powerful search engine with rules combination much like in Finder which was seriously lacking on Apple Mail Smart mailboxes like there were on

really related to RCTs per se this note is a summary of an article coming from Statistical Methods in Medical Researchhttpsmmsagepubcom 2010 vol 194 which is a special issue on Primary Care studies The abstract for the first article by Lancaster et al reads Trials carried out in primary care typically involve complex interventions that require considerable planning if they are to be implemented successfully The role of the statistician in promoting both robust study design and appropriate statistical analysis is an important contribution to a multidisciplinary primary care research group Issues in the design of complex interventions have been addressed in the Medical Research Councils new guidance document and over the past 7 years by the Royal Statistical Societys Primary Health Care Study Group With the aim of raising the profile of statistics and building research capability in this area particularly with respect to methodological issues the study group meetings have covered a wide range of topics that have been of interest to statisticians and nonstatisticians alike The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the statistical issues that have arisen over the years related to the design and evaluation of trials in primary care to provide useful examples and references for further study and ultimately to promote good practice in the conduct of complex interventions carried out in primary care and other health care settings Throughout we have given particular emphasis to statistical issues related to the design of cluster randomised trials Briefly I shall focus on the following issues 1 Choice of the randomization method subjects allocation use of clusters sample size in treatment groups covariates 2 Conditional vs marginal approach to analyse the outcome of interest in relation to the covariates Choice of the randomization method TODO To be described here Model fitting There are two broad class of models for fitting clusterized data clusterspecific CS and populationaveraged PA models The first one belongs to the class of conditional model whereas the second one follows from the marginal approach Their interpretation remains the same in the case of linear and loglinear models but in the case of a logistic link function the use of a PA model results in attenuated regression coefficients for the covariates of interest see below1 If we consider an outcome Y with expected value and the link function g defined as gmu eta beta0 beta1X Z with mathbb EZ 0 and textVarZ sigma2 Z independent of X we have a CS model which measures the effect of X variations on Y while Z is held constant The variable Z is just a random effect and this amount to add an effect Zi to all outcomes belonging to the same cluster Then it can be shown that omitting the variable Z yields a PA model eta beta0star beta1starX where we look at the average effect of X over the range of Z that is over all clusters It should be noted that now errors are correlated but this can easily be accomodated when fitting the model If we further assume that beta1star approx Bbeta1 where B stands for the bias factor then Neuhaus and Jewell1 show that B 1 for linear and loglinear model with mu textlogitPrY 1 mid X Z logistic link B becomes B 1 fracsigmaZ2mathbb Emu1mathbb Emu 1 rho where rho stands for the withincluster correlation assuming beta1 0 As rho is usually 001 in communitybased studies using a marginal model should not yield strong biases because in this case 0 B 1 and regression coefficients from the PA model are just a little bit shrinked How about estimation of model parameters With a continuous outcome y which is modeled as yij beta0 beta1Xi ij where ij Zi varepsilonij we can think of Zi as nuisance parameters and usual likelihoodbased methods apply using gaussian quadrature or Laplace approximation to eliminate the Zi Generally we make the additional assumption of an exchangeable correlation structure which amounts to consider that the variancecovariance matrix would remain the same if we exchange the withincluster units It should be noted that we can also consider using a loglinear model which would give relative risks instead of oddsratio References 1 Neuhaus JM and Jewell NP 1993 A geometric approach to assess bias due to omitted covariates in generalized linear models Biometrika 80

Markdownhttpdaringfireballnetprojectsmarkdownsyntax format worddleimg20110121111926png The hard and ugly way The first thing that comes to my mind is just to convert each file to individual HTML file and then assemble the whole stuff into a single file convertmdsh html htmldoc continuous charset utf8 color f chlstatsstackechange20110120pdf html where convertmdshhttpwwwaliquoteorgpubconvertmdsh features a simple loop for calling pandochttpjohnmacfarlanenetpandoc on the Markdown files Using htmldochttpwwwhtmldocorg rather than a compiled HTML file allows to quickly solve the problem of the Markdown link encoded as numbered references which wont update between each piece of HTML The other advantage is that htmldoc will fetch all linked images which are stored on although it is rather long But it appears that this is not a so good idea because then images are not croped or resized As a consequence it produces an ugly PDF file notwithstanding the fact that there appears to be some problem with long lines not breaking and TeX expressions rendered incorrectly Generating a single HTML file and then converting it to PDF with Apercuapp does not solve the problem The easy but pretty way This time I decided to assemble all files in a Context file For this to be possible I need each file as an independent TeX chunk decide of a common figure width and assemble the whole into a single document convertmdsh tex cat headertex alltex cat 09tex alltex echo stoptext alltex The file headertex includes the preamble for the master file This is a slightly modified version of the default header produced when calling markdown2pdf Im still working on it to enhance the layout and color scheme Here is the current copyhttpwwwaliquoteorgpubheadertex I am using The advantage is that Context handles inline images with URI without any problem the file is just downloaded into luatex cache and then reused from that location Here it doesnt work though and I get a libpng error Not a PNG file when running context on such a file It is very likely that there is a problem with URL handling in this particular case However it works perfectly well with other PNG files eg starttext externalfigurehttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb 00dConTeXtUnofficialLogos vg200pxConTeXtUnofficialLogosvgpng stoptext will compile using context but replacing the above link with a bitly shortcut httpjmpgOcjTShttpjmpgOcjTS doesnt So for the time being I just grab images on the fly and put them in the same folder and I make a targz just after Context files have been processed grep o colornever httpiimgurcompng alltex imglisttxt cat imglisttxt awk print 1 O xargs curl O silent sed shttpiimgurcomg all2tex texexec all2tex Note that we dont need to explicitly use a slash character as a delimiter with sed I used curl because wget q i imglisttxt doesnt work dont know why it said the URL is malformed but I suspect it is because of the presence of i The curl command is a little bit tricky because we need to add a O statement for each line in the file imglist Another solution is to use curl K with a list of URLs in a text file but then we need to convert this file to replace the raw URLS with url http I can also produce single PDF files and then concatenate them into a single file eg convertmdsh pdf s pdfjoin pdf o allpdf Here are two screenshots that show how it looks once

design","tags":["readings"],"href":"/around-survey-methodology","content":"Recently I read some books related to survey design and the way a questionnaire should be constructed so as to maximize the information we want to gain from it Among others I found Williss book Cognitive Interviewing A Tool for Improving Questionnaire Design 2005 well structured though some topics are developed far from what I would qualify as a really concise overview Other lectures included more statistical techniques oriented toward survey design and implementation This includes a concise but very dense book written by E S Lee and R N Forthofer Analyzing Complex Survey Data 2006 Sage Publications Also Ive reviewed various articles related to survey methodology for largescale educational assessments see references 5 and ff Apart from focusing on the precision of the related estimators an interesting issue arises when one wants to design effective sampling using a computer Indeed when conducting a survey we have to sample the units without replacement which is quite different from the usual asymptotic approach in behavioral studies where we mainly use random sampling with replacement hence assuming an infinite population Before presenting some of the main issues discussed in Williss book the interested reader may refer to the National Cancer InstituteNational Cancer Institute where some tutorials on Item Response Theory and Questionnaire Design are proposed In fact there is a short PDF article of Gordon Willis Cognitive Interviewing A How to GuideCognitive Interviewing A How to Guide I also found these PDF guidelinesguidelines on the Cooperative State Research Education and Extension Service Its not too surprising to find such material since cognitive interviewing has been mainly developed in the context of medical or psychological assessment Other references are given at the end of this post12 For a general overview of survey methodology please refer to 13 Hereafter I propose a quick summary of Williss book to help the reader understand what sits behind this sound wording First the book is intended to all questionnaire designers who are interested in how cognitive strategies might affect verbal or web responses The following book might also be of potential interest for the questionnairesurvey designer Designing and Conducting Health Surveys A Comprehensive Guide by Aday and Cornelius 2006 The TOC can be visualized here in PDF and there is an online chapter excerpt Chapter 1 in PDF on JosseyBass website Thinking about topics for health surveysThinking about topics for health surveys Further here is a general annotated bibliography on survey methodology aims methods caveats etc available as BibTeX fileBibTeX file or HTML pageHTML page There are several ways to implement online questionnaire Indeed various technologies have now become deployed over the internet including usual htmlPHP web form static or dynamic Perl CGI Macromedia Flash or even Java for mobile device I will propose soon some kind of demonstrations of each of these tools one day References 1 Hughes KA 2004 Comparing pretesting methods Cognitive interviews respondent

listhttpaliquoteorgpubarxivbib for the past couple of weeks arXiv180100631 Deep Learning A Critical Appraisalhttpsarxivorgabs180100631 Gary Marcus This is a brief review of deep learning in the light of the renewed interest for artificial intelligence that emerged during the last two years I believe it does not reflect the opinion of all researchers or practicioners but anyway there are some interesting references in there and as the author said this is deliberately oriented toward AI research not machine learning or data science The author summarizes ten concerns regarding deep learning which essentially turn around the generalizability issue Here are some of them data hungriness and no caapcity to learn abstractions limited capacity to transfer knowledge beyond the scope that was used to learn the model no way to deal with hierarchical structure or openended inference blackbox approach no or poorly integration of prior knowledge unresolved causation versus correlation issue and assumption of a stable world In the last section the author suggests some ideas to go forward combined use of deep learning and unsupervised learning use of hybrid model to integrate symbolic information and gain more insights from cognitive psychology There was also a hot debate during NIPS 2017 on the interpretability issue in machine learning see eg Yann Lecuns replyhttpswwwredditcomrMachineLearningcomments7i1uernyannlecunresponsetoalirahimisnipslecture on Reddit arXiv171209988 Orthogonal ML for Demand Estimation High Dimensional Causal Inference in Dynamic Panelshttpsarxivorgabs171209988 Victor Chernozhukov Matt Goldman Vira Semenova Matt Taddy The authors discuss Machine Learning ML methods that can be used to facilitate model selection and the estimation of treatment effect in economic policy analysis In particular they emphasize the double ML frameworkhttpseconomicsmitedufiles12591 which they previsouly demonstrated to be useful to partial out the influence of potential controls Basically this amounts to estimate log price and sales conditional on lagged values of those variables and then apply some penalization eg Lasso in a second stage where we want to explain heterogeneous demand elasticities by regressing residuals of the first model on indicators for location channel product or product type The study of heteregoneous treatment effects is not limited to econometrics but applies to observational data that have to deal with causal inference and the idea of potential outcomes It can be shown that the naive estimator of the average treatment effect ATE can be decomposed as the sum of Ei and pretreatment and treatmenteffect heterogeneity biases See Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Analysishttpswwwstatacommeetinggermany10germany10jannpdf by Jann or Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects with Observational DatahttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMC3591476 by Xie et al It is then essential to eliminate those bias especially the first one arXiv170300864 The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Structured Random Orthogonal Embeddingshttpsarxivorgabs170300864 Krzysztof Choromanski Mark Rowland Adrian Weller This article deals with embedded methods in Machine Learning but not really the one I was thinking about ie embedded methods that peform variable selection during the learning phase of an ML algorithm when I downloaded the paper As many NIPS papers it is rather technical and I had a very hard time following it The core idea is that random orthomatrices that is structured gaussian or SDproduct random matrices with orthogonal rows can be used for dimensionality reduction via orthogonal JohnsonLindenstrauss TransformhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiJohnsonLindenstrausslemma or

but its still statistics But see also his followup post I am a data scientisthttpskbromanwordpresscom20160408iamadatascientist Source httpaliquoteorgpubimgBfOTdpkIUAA0UXAjpglargejpeg In the present

preparation and exploration 2 data representation and transformation 3 computing with data 4 data modeling 5 data visualization and presentation and 6 science about data science Many blog or online discussion are referenced throughout the article as well as more scholarly published work The authors emphasize the need for effective teaching of scientific reasoning data visualization and

and covariates displays of distributions bootstrap replication prediction error comparing models generalization and causality that the author recommend to start teaching data science are merely related to statistical computing and statistical inference uisng the R statistical package as far as I can tell and so it is likely that the apparent lack of a consensual definition of data science still remain an open issue in 2018 arXiv180100364 Estimation and Inference of Treatment Effects with L2Boosting in HighDimensional Settingshttpsarxivorgabs180100364 Ye Luo Martin Spindler Per the paper abstract the authors give results for the valid inference of a treatment effect after selecting from among very many control variables and the estimation of instrumental variables with potentially very many instruments when post or orthogonal L2Boosting is used for the variable selection There are some connections with the arXiv171209988httpsarxivorgabs171209988 paper discussed above in particular the estimation of treatment effect in highdimensional settings relies on orthogonalized moment conditions which are moment conditions imposed by a statistical model to estimate

conference","tags":["travels","review","psychometrics"],"href":"/back-from-the-iv-eam-conference","content":"Back from the IV EAM conferenceIV EAM conference that was held in Postdam near Berlin The next one is planned in two years in Spain In the mean time I expect great publications coming up from some of the presenters There was a lot of interesting talks although five parallel sessions inevitably led to tedious alternative forced choice decisions unless ones willing to run from one room to another in less than 2 minutes but this is not my case I particularly appreciated the talk given by Keith F Widaman Testing theoretical conjectures directly using constrained regression analysis The talk started with a review of Meehls paradox and elaborated on the usefulness of always testing against the null hypothesis of a null effect He rather emphasized the difference between null hypothesis as seen in Physics where we are interested in how observations differ from predictions vs those classically found in psychology where we most of the times test the no effect H0 within the Fishers framework for testing hypothesis The idea was then to set up a different effect under H0 and use regression analysis following the assumption of fixed effect eg constant ratio between two regression coefficients Nice work to follow on I also attended Andries van der Arks talk and I am now waiting for the shipping of his book on Marginal modelsMarginal models The basic idea is that most if not all of the models that are currently headed under the IRT framework might be seen as marginal models I look forward to read the entire book There was also interesting discussions around CAT in clinical setting It has been successfully applied when investigating anxiety Walter et al 2007 and depression Fliege et al 2005 Interestingly N Smits constrasted CAT as used in a measurement perspective vs prediction or diagnosis context ie where one only wants to assign a given patient to one of two diagonstic groups Also Paul De Boecks keynote was greatly appreciated it focused on categories ie categorical attributes and dimensions ie unidimensional scales and helped to highlight the close proximity between these two conceptual vision of what may be classified and what may be ordered on a metric scale The basic conclusion is that both can be nested together or even exchangeable Mixture item response models constitute a promising approach in psychometrics but we need to look at the third and fourth moments to see the difference between a latent profile model with p parameters and a factor model with p1 parameters As a conclusion I rest on my idea that latent variables might be thought of as tools constructed to answer specific questions rather than true constructs envisioned

of addons especially to assist coding activity autocomplete snippets connection to various REPLs etc I wanted to do the same but without using the complete overtone configuration files Thats almost done Be sure to grab one of the 24 series in the build repositoryhttpemacsformacosxcombuilds I personally choosed the 241rc pretest version I havent had any problem so far To configure ELPA we can add the following two lines in our emacs lisp setq packagearchives marmalade httpmarmaladerepoorgpackages tromey httptromeycomelpa This will add Marmaladehttpmarmaladerepoorg as well as Tromey ELPA to the default GNU repository Something thats really important is to configure the keyboard I just added lisp setq macoptionmodifier none in order to exchange command the option and command keys Otherwise we cannot type symbols like Altn or use square brackets which is pretty sad when writing R code Other customizations can be added for example to make the connection with Mac pbpaste more transparent I was aware of Yasnippethttpcapitaomortegithubcomyasnippet which is inspired from Textmatehttpmacromatescom but I just gave it a try in the past Now Im using it and it seems the trigger key is not too intrusive when Im typing I am also trying to familiarize myself with idomodehttpemacswikiorgemacsInteractivelyDoThings that Ive never used lisp require ido idomode t My first impressions were disconcerting but now I seem to get used to it I just have to remember that I now have to Cd to get into diredmode for browsing content of a directory My emacs is not entirely clean at the moment I need to investigate the autoload vs requirehttpanickelsworthblogspotfr200711effectiveemacshtml issue more carefully For the moment I am quite happy with the configuration of Lisp Clojure R and Python I can connect to slime using either lein swank or Mx clojurejackin from within Emacs For R I have Yasnippetshttpsgithubcomcapitaomorteyasnippet working right out of the box together with other goodies from ESShttpessrprojectorg I was previously using adomodehttphomepagemaccombrisingStata but essmode provides most of the basic functionalities I need for interacting with Stata An example of an interactive R session is shown below Emacs 1img20120616124927png Top panel shows how Yasnippet prompting tool is triggered when pressing tab while bottom panel shows available arguments when typing rnorm in the R shell directly Here is another screenshot which show the beginning of a clojure script with autocompletion and a running lein shell Emacs 2img20120616165557png Next screenshot shows two

Macbook everyday day or so has crashed Back to a Time Capsule and the joy of the first synchronization Here are some background information for the record I owned a Time Capsule TC three years ago which crashed after 6 months of use I switched to an external HD with firewire on my old Macbook Pro and I was pretty happy with that since daily backup didnt take a long time When I got the new Airbook which lacks Firewire connecticity I relied on simple USB backup on a 500 Go external HD Backup time was in the acceptable range Im back to a TC now The Time Capsule is really easy to configure especially when we just want it to be connected to our network as a simple client This is entirely done with Airport utility Then we just have to change Time Machine setting to tell it to use the TC HD for backups and then well we just have to wait for a long very long time How long do you say Waitingimg20120615230808png Who said we live in a wireless land The above time is for the case where we are using wireless access to the TC with the TC configured as a client to my home wireless network We can get more reasonnable timing by creating a network for the Time Capsule which is the default option and connecting the Macbook and the TC directly with an ethernet cable as documented on Apples KB Backing up with Time Capsule for the first timehttpsupportapplecomkbHT1175 Of course you will need an ethernet adapter for your Macbook This way I got something like 90 Go saved in 35 hours I know we can connect external HDs or printer to the TC What about connecting the Airs SuperDrive This simply doesnt work That is so generous of you Apple Next step Accessing the TC when I am out of my home network"},{"title":"Backup

also expect it to serve as a gateway between two Mac a Mac Mini at home and my Airbook at workmore to say later Problem with local backup is that if the disk crashed or something bad happens at home

X","tags":["apple"],"href":"/bash42-zsh5","content":"Here is a brief description on how to update to newer versions of Bash and zsh on OS X Few hours after I wrote some notes on Customizing terminal emulator and the like on OS X I just decided to update my old version of Bash believe it or not I was still using the one that shiped with my MacBook Air when I got it two years ago ie 3248 There are quick tutorials for installing Bash by little googling I followed this one and everything worked fine Change to new BASH Shell 41 for Mac OS XhttpbitlyNsQiT2 Just make sure to grab the latest version of Bash from a GNU server The last points 612 are important if we want to make the system aware of our new interpreter For zsh I downloaded the master zipball from GitHubhttpsgithubcomzshuserszsh The install instructions in the INSTALL file contains everything that is needed to compile zsh with the following minor exception I got an error compiling the documentation which is contained in zshtexi According to this threadhttpstackoverflowcomquestions6894790zshcompilationprobleminosx on Stack Overflow we need Yodlhttpyodlsourceforgenet on OS X And of course to compile Yodl you need yet another program icmakehttpicmakesourceforgenet If you dont really care about the manpages and the help manual you can skip what follows and just follow with make check sudo make install We can check that we now have the latest version of zsh usrlocalbinzsh version zsh 500 x8664appledarwin1140 As I am using iTerm2httpwwwiterm2com I just configured this new version as my default zsh interpreter in the Preferences panel OS X Preference panelimg20120724125723png We can then launch an new Terminal and see whether everything is working print ZSHVERSION 500 AFAIK theres no help command like in Bash To compile icmake you will have to replace every define by export if you are using Bash in INSTALLim and you might want to change the target directories I prefer to put everything in usrlocal but thats not necessary Just run icmbootstrap usrlocalshareicmake71600 sudo icminstall all sudo ln s usrlocalshareicmake71600 usrlocalshareicmake and add usrlocalshareicmake to your PATH eg for this session export PATHusrlocalshareicmakePATH One can also symlink executables to a more convenient place eg usrlocalbin Then proceed with Yodl In INSTALLim change the install directory in setLocations at the end of the file Eg I used BASE usrlocal Please note that the build program assumes that icmake is located in usrbin How funny So lets change the shebang line so that it now reads usrlocalshareicmake qttmpyodl I stopped here myself because theres a problem with compiling yodl that I dont have time to investigate more carefully I will update this section later Yes I promise One day I will switch to

useful reference for R users is Bayesian Computation with R in the Springers UseR series from J ALbert First of all I found that graphical displays are overall very nicely drawn on the BW version of the book For instance the two plots below include all information I ever wanted to see from a logistic regression here exported at 300 DPI for better viewing Chapters 9 10 and 23 provide important discussions and illustrations regarding causal inference and are wellsuited for biomedical studies eg what variables shall we control for in pre and posttreatment studies There are also interesting illustration with IRT in Chapter 14 A Gelman makes extensive use of BUGS for bayesian computation but BUGS software doesnt work on Mac OS X With the newly released version of JAGS 210 as of May the 12th it must however be possible to do most of the computation shown in Gelmans book The corresponding R packages are called rjagsrjags and R2jagsR2jags the latter being developed by one of Gelmans student YuSung Su JAGS stands for Just Another Gibbs Sampler and is a tool for analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo MCMC simulation but see M Plummers main article1 In R2jags the rjags function ensures the main part of the computation and need a proper BUGS model stored in a text file In the follwoing we will restrict ourselves on the original rjags package For the sake of illustration we will consider the following example from Broemelings book Bayesian Biostatistics and Diagnostic Medicine Chapman HallCRC 2007 It is a metaanalysis on 22 RCTs of betablockers to prevent mortality after myocardial infarction which is available in WinBUGS example data set2 An example of the available data is shown in the following table Trial Treated Control

multivariate analog of scatter plots using multidimensional scaling to approximate the multivariate distribution of a sample in a few dimensions to produce a graphical display In addition they superimpose representations of the variables on this display so that the relationships between the sample and the variables can be studied Like scatter plots biplots are useful for detecting patterns

Medicine suddenly came out in my Google feed reader Way too many to tweet them all so here is a brief list of papers I should read during my forthcoming week off Some papers come from a special issue

methodshttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim4304abstractjsessionid3BA8C67F6549A3AD4D5E10FB29B4D8F5d01t04 Measurement error ME problems can cause bias or inconsistency of statistical inferences When investigators are unable to obtain correct measurements of biological assays special techniques to quantify MEs need to be applied Sampling based on repeated measurements is a common strategy to allow for ME This method has been well addressed in the literature under parametric assumptions The approach with repeated measures data may not be applicable when the replications are complicated because of cost andor time concerns Pooling designs have been proposed as costefficient sampling procedures that can assist to provide correct statistical operations based on data subject to ME We demonstrate that a mixture of both pooled and unpooled data a hybrid pooledunpooled design can support very efficient estimation and testing in the presence of ME Nonparametric techniques have not been well investigated to analyze repeated measures data or pooled data subject to ME We propose and examine both the parametric and empirical likelihood methodologies for data subject to ME We conclude that the likelihood methods based on the hybrid samples are very efficient and powerful The results of an extensive Monte Carlo study support our conclusions Real data examples demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods in practice 2 Chevret S Bayesian adaptive clinical trials a dream for statisticians onlyhttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim4363abstract Adaptive or flexible designs have emerged mostly within frequentist frameworks as an effective way to speed up the therapeutic evaluation process Because of their flexibility Bayesian methods have also been proposed for Phase I through Phase III adaptive trials however it has been reported that they are poorly used in practice We aim to describe the international scientific production of Bayesian clinical trials by investigating the actual development and use of Bayesian adaptive methods in the setting of clinical trials A bibliometric study was conducted using the PubMed and Science Citation IndexExpanded databases Most of the references found were biostatistical papers from various teams around the world Most of the authors were from the US and a large proportion was from the MD Anderson Cancer Center University of Texas Houston TX The spread and use of these articles depended heavily on their topic with 31 of the biostatistical articles accumulating at least 25 citations within 5 years of their publication compared with 15 of the reviews and 32 of the clinical articles We also examined the reasons for the limited use of Bayesian adaptive design methods in clinical trials and the areas of current and future research to address these challenges Efforts to promote Bayesian approaches among statisticians and clinicians appear necessary 3 Hardouin JB Amri S Feddag ML Sbille V Towards power and sample size calculations for the comparison of two groups of patients with item response theory modelshttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim4387abstract Evaluation of patientreported outcomes PRO is increasingly performed in health sciences PRO differs from other measurements because such patient characteristics cannot be directly observed Item response theory IRT is an attractive way for PRO analysis However in the framework of IRT sample size justification is rarely provided or ignores the fact that PRO measures are latent variables with the use of formulas developed for observed variables It might therefore be inappropriate and might provide inadequately sized studies The objective was to develop valid sample size methodology for the comparison of PRO in two groups of patients using IRT The proposed approach takes into account questionnaires items parameters the difference of the latent variables means and its variance whose derivation is approximated using CramerRao bound CRB We also computed the associated power We realized a simulation study taking into account sample size number of items and value of the group effect We compared power obtained from CRB with the one obtained from simulations SIM and with the power based on observed variables OBS For a given sample size powers using CRB and SIM were similar and always lower than OBS We observed a strong impact of the number of items for CRB and SIM the power increasing with the questionnaires length but not for OBS In the context of latent variables it seems important to use an adapted sample size formula because the formula developed for observed variables seems to be inadequate and leads to an underestimated study size 4 Dazard JE Rao JS Markowitz S Local sparse bump hunting reveals molecular heterogeneity of colon tumorshttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim4389abstract The question of molecular heterogeneity and of tumoral phenotype in cancer remains unresolved To understand the underlying molecular basis of this phenomenon we analyzed genomewide expression data of colon cancer metastasis samples as these tumors are the most advanced and hence would be anticipated to be the most likely heterogeneous group of tumors potentially exhibiting the maximum amount of genetic heterogeneity Casting a statistical net around such a complex problem proves difficult because of the high dimensionality and multicollinearity of the gene expression space combined with the fact that genes act in concert with one another and that not all genes surveyed might be involved We devise a strategy to identify distinct subgroups of samples and determine the geneticmolecular signature that defines them This involves use of the local sparse bump hunting algorithm which provides a much more optimal and biologically faithful transformed space within which to search for bumps In addition thanks to the variable selection feature of the algorithm we derived a novel sparse gene expression signature which appears to divide all colon cancer patients into two populations a population whose expression pattern can be molecularly encompassed within the bump and an outlier population that cannot be Although all patients within any given stage of the disease including the metastatic group appear clinically homogeneous our procedure revealed two subgroups in each stage with distinct geneticmolecular profiles We also discuss implications of such a finding in terms of early detection diagnosis and prognosis 5 Ambler G Seaman S Omar RZ An evaluation of penalised survival methods for developing prognostic models with rare eventshttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim4371abstract Prognostic models for survival outcomes are often developed by fitting standard survival regression models such as the Cox proportional hazards model to representative datasets However these models can be unreliable if the datasets contain few events which may be the case if either the disease or the event of interest is rare Specific problems include predictions that are too extreme and poor discrimination between lowrisk and highrisk patients The objective of this paper is to evaluate three existing penalised methods that have been proposed to improve predictive accuracy In particular ridge lasso and the garotte which use penalised maximum likelihood to shrink coefficient estimates and in some cases omit predictors entirely are assessed using simulated data derived from two clinical datasets The predictions obtained using these methods are compared with those from Cox models fitted using standard maximum likelihood The simulation results suggest that Cox models fitted using maximum likelihood can perform poorly when there are few events and that significant improvements are possible by taking a penalised modelling approach The ridge method generally performed the best although lasso is recommended if variable selection is required 6 Lee W Gusnanto A Salim A Magnusson P Sim X Tai ES Pawitan Y Estimating the number of true discoveries in genomewide association studieshttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim4391abstract Recent genomewide association studies have reported the discoveries of genetic variants of small to moderate effects However most studies of complex diseases face a great challenge because the number of significant variants is less than what is required to explain the disease heritability A new approach is needed to recognize all potential discoveries in the data In this paper we present a practical modelfree procedure to estimate the number of true discoveries as a function of the number of topranking SNPs together with the confidence bounds This approach allows a practical methodology of general utility and produces relevant statistical quantities with simple interpretation 7 Geloven N Broeze KA Opmeer BC Mol BW Zwinderman AH How to deal with double partial verification when evaluating two index tests in relation to a reference testhttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim4440abstract Research into the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests is often hampered by single or double partial verification mechanisms that is not all patients have their disease status verified by a reference test neither do all patients receive all tests under evaluation index tests We show methods that reduce verification bias introduced when omitting data from partially tested patients Adjustment techniques are well established when there are no missing index tests and when the reference test is missing at random However in practice index tests tend to be omitted and the choice of applying a reference test may depend on unobserved variables related to disease status that is verification may be missing not at random MNAR We study double partial verification in a clinical example from reproductive medicine in which we analyse the diagnostic values of the chlamydia antibody test and the hysterosalpingography in relation to a diagnostic laparoscopy First we plot all possible combinations of sensitivity and specificity of both index tests in two test ignorance regions Then we construct models in which we impose different assumptions for the verification process We allow for missing index tests study the influence of patient characteristics and study the accuracy estimates if an MNAR mechanism would operate It is shown that data on tests used in the diagnostic process of the same population are preferably studied jointly and that the influence of an MNAR verification process was limited in a clinical study where more than half of the patients did not have the reference test 8 Pfeiffer RM Forzani L Bura E Sufficient dimension reduction for longitudinally measured predictorshttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim4437abstract We propose a method to combine several predictors markers that are measured repeatedly over time into a composite marker score without assuming a model and only requiring a mild condition on the predictor distribution Assuming that the first and second moments of the predictors can be decomposed into a time and a marker component via a Kronecker product structure that accommodates the longitudinal nature of the predictors we develop firstmoment sufficient dimension reduction techniques to replace the original markers with linear transformations that contain sufficient information for the regression of the predictors on the outcome These linear combinations can then be combined into a score that has better predictive performance than a score built under a general model that ignores the longitudinal structure of the data Our methods can be applied to either continuous or categorical outcome measures In simulations we focus on binary outcomes and show that our method outperforms existing alternatives by using the AUC the area under the receiveroperator characteristics ROC curve as a summary measure of the discriminatory ability of a single continuous diagnostic marker for binary disease outcomes 9 Kifley A Heller GZ Beath KJ Bulger D Ma J Gebski V Multilevel latent variable models for global healthrelated quality of life assessmenthttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim4455abstract Quality of life QOL assessment is a key component of many clinical studies and frequently requires the use of single global summary measures that capture the overall balance of findings from a potentially wideranging assessment of QOL issues We propose and evaluate an irregular multilevel latent variable model suitable for use as a global summary tool for healthrelated QOL assessments The proposed model is a multiple indicator and multiple cause style of model with a twolevel latent variable structure We approach the modeling from a general multilevel modeling perspective using a combination of random and nonrandom cluster types to accommodate the mixture of issues commonly evaluated in healthrelated QOL assessmentsoverall perceptions of QOL and health along with specific psychological physical social and functional issues Using clinical trial data we evaluate the merits and application of this approach in detail both for mean global QOL and for change from baseline We show that the proposed model generally performs well in comparing global patterns of treatment effect and provides more precise and reliable estimates than several common alternatives such as selecting from or averaging observed global item measures A variety of computational methods could be used for estimation We derived a closedform expression for the marginal likelihood that can be used to obtain maximum likelihood parameter estimates when normality assumptions are reasonable Our approach is useful for QOL evaluations aimed at pharmacoeconomic or individual clinical decision making and in obtaining summary QOL measures for use in qualityadjusted survival analyses 10 Banerjee M Ding Y Noone AM Identifying representative trees from ensembleshttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim4492abstract Treebased methods have become popular for analyzing complex data structures where the primary goal is risk stratification of patients Ensemble techniques improve the accuracy in prediction and address the instability in a single tree by growing an ensemble of trees and aggregating However in the process individual trees get lost In this paper we propose a methodology for identifying the most representative trees in an ensemble on the basis of several tree distance metrics Although our focus is on binary outcomes the methods are applicable to censored data as well For any two trees the distance metrics are chosen to 1 measure similarity of the covariates used to split the trees 2 reflect similar clustering of patients in the terminal nodes of the trees and 3 measure similarity in predictions from the two trees Whereas the latter focuses on prediction the first two metrics focus on the architectural similarity between two trees The most representative trees in the ensemble are chosen on the basis of the average distance between a tree and all other trees in the ensemble Outofbag estimate of error rate is obtained using neighborhoods of representative trees Simulations and data examples show gains in predictive accuracy when averaging over such neighborhoods We illustrate our methods using a dataset of kidney cancer treatment receipt binary outcome and a second dataset of breast cancer survival censored outcome 11 Pencina MJ DAgostino RB Song L Quantifying discrimination of Framingham risk functions with different survival C statisticshttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim4508abstract Cardiovascular risk prediction functions offer an important diagnostic tool for clinicians and patients themselves They are usually constructed with the use of parametric or semiparametric survival regression models It is essential to be able to evaluate the performance of these models preferably with summaries that offer natural and intuitive interpretations The concept of discrimination popular in the logistic regression context has been extended to survival analysis However the extension is not unique In this paper we define discrimination in survival analysis as the models ability to separate those with longer eventfree survival from those with shorter eventfree survival within some time horizon of interest This definition remains consistent with that used in logistic regression in the sense that it assesses how well the modelbased predictions match the observed data Practical and conceptual examples and numerical simulations are employed to examine four C statistics proposed in the literature to evaluate the performance of survival models We observe that they differ in the numerical values and aspects of discrimination that they capture We conclude that the index proposed by Harrell is the most appropriate to capture discrimination described by the above definition We suggest researchers report which C statistic they are using provide a rationale for their selection and be aware that comparing different indices across studies may not be meaningful 12 Archer KJ Williams AAA L1 penalized continuation ratio models for ordinal response prediction using highdimensional datasetshttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim4484abstract Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale For highthroughput genomic datasets the common approach to analyzing ordinal response data has been to break the problem into one or more dichotomous response analyses This dichotomous response approach does not make use of all available data and therefore leads to loss of power and increases the number of type I errors Herein we describe an innovative frequentist approach that combines two statistical techniques L 1 penalization and continuation ratio models for modeling an ordinal response using gene expression microarray data We conducted a simulation study to assess the performance of two computational approaches and two model selection criteria for fitting frequentist L 1 penalized continuation ratio models Moreover we empirically compared the approaches using three application datasets each of which seeks to classify an ordinal class using microarray gene expression data as the predictor variables We conclude that the L 1 penalized constrained continuation ratio model is a useful approach for modeling an ordinal response for datasets where the number of covariates p exceeds the sample size n and the decision of whether to use Akaike Information Criterion AIC or Bayesian Information Criterion BIC for selecting the final model should depend upon the similarities between the pathologies underlying the disease states to be classified 13 Li Y Baser R Using R and WinBUGS to fit a generalized partial credit model for developing and evaluating patientreported outcomes assessmentshttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim4475abstract The US Food and Drug Administration recently announced the final guidelines on the development and validation of patientreported outcomes PROs assessments in drug labeling and clinical trials This guidance paper may boost the demand for new PRO survey questionnaires Henceforth biostatisticians may encounter psychometric methods more frequently particularly item response theory IRT models to guide the shortening of a PRO assessment instrument This article aims to provide an introduction on the theory and practical analytic skills in fitting a generalized partial credit model GPCM in IRT GPCM theory is explained first with special attention to a clearer exposition of the formal mathematics than what is typically available in the psychometric literature Then a worked example is presented using selfreported responses taken from the international personality item pool The worked example contains stepbystep guides on using the statistical languages r and WinBUGS in fitting the GPCM Finally the Fisher information function of the GPCM model is derived and used to evaluate as an illustrative example the usefulness of assessment items by their information contents This article aims to encourage biostatisticians to apply IRT models in the reanalysis of existing data and in future research 14 Nietert PJ Wahlquist AE

methods are continuously being developed within the context of biomedical research however the characteristics of biostatistics methods that have been adopted by researchers publishing in generalinternal medicine GIM journals are unclear This study highlights the statistical journal articles the statistical journals and the types of statistical methods that appear to be having the most direct impact on research published in GIM journals We used descriptive techniques including analyses of articles keywords and controlled vocabulary terms to characterize the articles published in statistics and probability journals that were subsequently referenced within GIM journal articles during a recent 10year period 20002009 From the 45 statistics and probability journals of interest we identified a total of 597 unique articles as being cited by 900 of a total of about 10501 unique GIM journal articles The most frequently cited statistical topics included generalother statistical methods followed by epidemiologic methods randomized trials generalized linear models metaanalysis and missing data As statisticians continue to develop and refine techniques the promotion and adoption of these methods should also be addressed so that their efforts spent in developing the methods are not carried out in vain 15 Viroli C Using factor mixture analysis to model heterogeneity cognitive structure and determinants of dementia an application to the Aging Demographics and Memory Studyhttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim5320abstract The Aging Demographics and Memory Study is the first extensive study of cognitive impairment and dementia of population in the USA A large sample of participants with ages 71 years or older has answered an indepth questionnaire which included an extensive cognitive assessment One of the principal aims of the study was to assign a diagnosis of dementia cognitive impairment but not demented or normal to the respondents Because of this heterogeneity we apply factor mixture model to the set of neuropsychological measures of the study in order to perform clustering of subjects and dimension reduction simultaneously Moreover we consider an extended variant of the model by incorporating a set of demographics and clinical covariates which directly affect the latent variables of the factor mixture model The interest of the analysis is to investigate whether respondents exhibit the same association of overall cognitive functioning with the covariates or whether groups of respondents exist that exhibit different association with the covariates indicating different determinants of overall cognitive functioning 16 Mukherjee B Ko YA VanderWeele T Roy A Park SK Chen J Principal interactions analysis for repeated measures data application to genegene and geneenvironment interactionshttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim5315abstract Many existing cohorts with longitudinal data on environmental exposures occupational history lifestyle behavioral characteristics and health outcomes have collected genetic data in recent years In this paper we consider the problem of modeling genegene and geneenvironment interactions with repeated measures data on a quantitative trait We review possibilities of using classical models proposed by Tukey 1949 and Mandel 1961 using the cell means of a twoway classification array for such data Although these models are effective for detecting interactions in the presence of main effects they fail miserably if the interaction structure is misspecified We explore a more robust class of interaction models that are based on a singular value decomposition of the cellmeans residual matrix after fitting the additive main effect terms This class of additive main effects and multiplicative interaction models Gollob 1968 provide useful summaries for subjectspecific and timevarying effects as represented in terms of their contribution to the leading eigenvalues of the interaction matrix It also makes the interaction structure more amenable to geometric representation We call this analysis principal interactions analysis While the paper primarily focuses on a cellmeanbased analysis of repeated measures outcome we also introduce resamplingbased methods that appropriately recognize the unbalanced and longitudinal nature of the data instead of reducing the response to cell means We illustrate the proposed methods by using data from the Normative Aging Study a longitudinal cohort study of Boston area veterans since 1963 We carry out simulation studies under an array of classical interaction models and common epistasis models to illustrate the properties of the principal interactions analysis procedure in comparison with the classical alternatives 17 Gaio AR da Costa JP Santos AC Ramos E Lopes C A restricted mixture model for dietary pattern analysis in small sampleshttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim5336abstract Multivariate finite mixture models have been applied to the identification of dietary patterns These models are known to have many parameters and consequently large samples are usually required We present a special case of a multivariate mixture model that reduces the number of parameters to be estimated and seems adequate for small to moderately sized samples We illustrate our approach with an analysis of Portuguese data from a foodfrequency questionnaire and with a simulation study 18 Pan Y Haber M Gao J Barnhart HX A new permutationbased method for assessing agreement between two observers making replicated quantitative readingshttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim5323abstract The coefficient of individual equivalence is a permutationbased measure of agreement between two observers making replicated readings on each subject It compares the observed disagreement between the observers to the expected disagreement under individual equivalence Individual equivalence of observers requires that for every study subject the conditional distributions of the readings of the observers given the subjects characteristics are identical Therefore under individual equivalence it does not matter which observer is making a particular reading on a given subject We introduce both nonparametric and parametric methods to estimate the coefficient as well as its standard error We compare the new coefficient with the coefficient of individual agreement and with the concordance correlation coefficient We also evaluate the performance of the estimates of the new coefficient via simulations and illustrate this new approach using data from a study comparing two noninvasive techniques for measuring carotid stenosis to an invasive gold standard 19 Androulakis E Koukouvinos C Vonta F Estimation and variable selection via frailty models with penalized likelihoodhttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim5325abstract The penalized likelihood methodology has been consistently demonstrated to be an attractive shrinkage and selection method It does not only automatically and consistently select the important variables but also produces estimators that are as efficient as the oracle estimator In this paper we apply this approach to a general likelihood function for data organized in clusters which corresponds to a class of frailty models which includes the Cox model and the Gamma frailty model as special cases Our aim was to provide practitioners in the medical or reliability field with options other than the Gamma frailty model which has been extensively studied because of its mathematical convenience We illustrate the penalized likelihood methodology for frailty models through simulations and real data 20 Aalen OO Armitage lecture 2010 Understanding treatment effects the value of integrating longitudinal data and survival analysishttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim5324abstract There is a singleminded focus on events in survival analysis and we often ignore longitudinal data that are collected together with the event data This is due to a lack of methodology but also a result of the artificial distinction between survival and longitudinal data analyses Understanding the dynamics of such processes is important but has been hampered by a lack of appreciation of the difference between confirmatory and exploratory causal inferences The latter represents an attempt at elucidating mechanisms by applying mediation analysis to statistical data and will usually be of a more tentative character than a confirmatory analysis The concept of local independence and the associated graphs are useful This is related to Granger causality an important method from econometrics that is generally undervalued by statisticians This causality concept is different from the counterfactual one since it lacks lacks the intervention aspect The notion that one can intervene at will in naturally occurring processes which seems to underly much of modern causal inference is problematic when studying mediation and mechanisms It is natural to assume a stochastic process point of view when analyzing dynamic relationships We present some examples to illustrate this It is not clear how survival analysis must be developed to handle the complex lifehistory data that are increasingly being collected today We give some suggestions 21 Desantis SM Houseman EA Coull BA Nutt CL Betensky RA Supervised Bayesian latent class models for highdimensional datahttponlinelibrarywileycomdoi101002sim4448abstract Highgrade gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults and are typically diagnosed using histopathology However these diagnostic categories are highly heterogeneous and do not always correlate well with survival In an attempt to refine these diagnoses we make several immunohistochemical measurements of YKL40 a gene previously shown to be differentially expressed between diagnostic groups We propose two latent class models for classification and variable selection in the presence of highdimensional binary data fit by using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques Penalization and model selection are incorporated in this setting via prior distributions on the unknown parameters The methods provide valid parameter estimates under conditions in which standard supervised latent class models do not and outperform twostage approaches to variable selection and parameter estimation in a variety of settings We study the properties of these methods in simulations and apply these methodologies to the glioma study for which identifiable threeclass parameter estimates cannot be obtained without penalization With penalization the resulting latent classes correlate well with clinical tumor grade and offer additional information on survival prognosis that is not captured by clinical diagnosis alone The inclusion of YKL40 features also increases the precision of survival estimates Fitting models with and without YKL40 highlights a subgroup of patients who have glioblastoma GBM diagnosis but appear to have better prognosis than the typical GBM patient"},{"title":"Cabal

AA Templin J and Henson RA 2010 Diagnostic Measurement Theory Methods and Applicationshttpdcmcoeugaedu Guilford Press A wellknown model is the socalled DINA model for dichotomous items which stands for deterministicinput noisyAND model It relies on the idea that a particular examinee need to master some skills attributes to endorse a given set of items This relationship between items and attributes is operationalized into a Qmatrix which has binary elements qjk indicating whether mastery of the kth attribute is required by the jth item We also consider a vector of indicators for subject is attribute mastery for the k attributes In the DINA model items divide the population of examinees in two latent classes those who have all required attributes and those who dont2 Lacking one required attribute for an item is the same as lacking all the required attributes and this model assumes equal probability of success for all attribute vectors in each latent group a condition that is relaxed in the generalized DINA model3 At first sight it shares some of the ideas of clustering or better latent class modelshttpwwwieanlfileadminuseruploadIRCIRC2008PapersIRC2008ChiuSeoetalpdf The idea of considering items bundle is not new think testlet or the linear logistic test model911 which allows to take into account item properties or its generalization the random weights LLTM13 Other IRT models are listed in Table 2 p 997 of DiBello et als chapter The Qmatrix in the DINA model specifies the set of latent traits necessary for each item and it is comparable to the weight matrix in the LLTM or loadings in factor analysis Importantly it permits withinitem multidimensionality items needing more than one

the Quartz device I already have Aquatermhttpsourceforgenetprojectsaquaterm installed on my Airbook but it is well known that it is only available in 32bit mode This means that we need to build Gnuplot for 32bit aka i386 architecture although I found some webpages showing that we can patch Aquaterm to run in 64bit Anyway lets go for an i386 architecture I dont really care because this is what Im actually running most of the time As we also want tikz and lua support for exporting to Latex we need liblua I already have Lua 51 but it was built for 64bit architecture So I downloaded it again and recompile it following the standard instructions Note that the default is an x8664 binary whereas I need to have an i386 build too I used this modified

again","tags":["readings","psychometrics"],"href":"/cronbach-s-alpha-yet-again","content":"As a complement to the references I gave in an earlier post on Cronbachs alpha here are some further thoughts I am rereading Health Measurement Scales A practical Guide to their development and use by DL Streiner and GR Norman Oxford Univ Press 2008 4th ed I thought it would be a good opportunity to put again some words about Cronbachs alpha This is a very nice textbook on the developement and validation of measurement instruments with a lot of examples in the field of health outcomes or clinical research Notations are clear and wellexplained and there are some good illustrations For example we all know that Cronbachs alpha depends on the interitem correlations and the number of items Their Figure 51 p 91 which is comparable to what I showed in my earlier post makes it clear that we can arbitrarily increase by increasing the number of items in the scale no need for complex digressions Moreover quoting the authors who discuss pp 9091 the problem of accepting high values of during scale development and interpreting them as reflecting good internal consistency If we have two scales which each measure a distinct construct and combine them to form one long scale will be high Cortina 1993 concluded that if a scale has more than 14 items then it will have an alpha of 070 or better even if it consists of two orthogonal dimensions with modest ie 030 item correlations If the dimensions are correlated with each other as they usually are then alpha is even greater p 102 Thats quite easy to check using R Here we simulate a twofactor structure generate N300 scores from it we could use the correlation matrix directly though and compute the average value observed for 100 replicates when

high level of item redundancy that is a number of items asking the same question in slightly different ways Boyle 1991 Hattie 1985 This may indicate that some of the items are unnecessary and that the scale as a whole may be too narrow in its scope to have much validity This raises the interesting question What is an acceptable value for Streiner and Norman conclude with the following A number of authors say it should be at least 070 eg Heppner et al 1992 Kaplan and Saccuzzo 1997 Nunnally 1978 states that this value should be obtained in the early stages of research but should be at least 080 for basic research a value also endorsed by Carmines and Zeller 1979 Clark and Watson 1995 and others and 090 for a clinical instrument A somewhat different approach is taken by Ponterotto and Ruckdeschel 2007 Because as we have said is influenced by the the length of the scale and the sample size they propose a range of values dependent on these factors Therefore for exmaple they would call a value of 070 good for a scale with fewer than seven items evaluated with fewer than 100 subjects However if the scale has more than 11 items and the sample size was over 300 would have to be 090 to be called good References 1 Cortina JM 1993 What Is Coefficient Alpha An Examination of Theory and Applicationshttppsychwebpsyumtedudenisdatadecisionfrontcortinaalphapdf Journal of Applied

and cross-over trials","tags":["readings","statistics"],"href":"/cross-over-trials","content":"Here are some notes on crossover trials and withinpatient titration in indirect assays Most of my litterature review started with Senns textbookhttpwwwsennsdemoncoukSIDDhtml Statistical Issues in Drug Development Wiley 2007 pp 317336 Contrary to direct assays where we know what we want to achieve say a given response to treatment and we adjust the dose until this goal is reached in indirect assays individual response is studied as a function of the dose and a useful dose is decided upon afterwards Studies on dose finding are generally done through between or withinsubject design In withinpatient designdose escalation or crossoverdoses are given in ascending order keeping in mind that withinpatient titration share most of the problems of crossover trials see below with additional limitations dose and period effects are confounded unless theres a parallel placebo group or an intervening placebo treatment in the dose escalation sequence In any case there seems to be some agreement on the fact that withinpatient designs crossover or dose escalation usually perform better than any parallelgroups design1 However the main difficulty with analyzing dose escalation studies is that it generally requires complex nonlinear randomeffects models which allow for dropout to be used In crossover trials patients are randomly allocated to a sequence of treatments where treatments are interleaved with active or passive washout periods Such a design is typical of a design where subject is taken as his own control and crossover trials are an example of a Latin square design where treatments appear only once in each period and in each sequence A simple design is the ABBA crossover where the two treatments under study are administered in both order A then B or B then A Carryover effects are of much concerns in this approach and even if different weighting schemes have been proposed to eliminate or render them innocuous it seems that the best is actually to take into account pharmacokinetic and pharmacological theories when devising washout period In the special case of singledose studies the washout period has been proven to be effective in general5 Some references are given in the References section but here is one good textbook by Stephen Senn himself Senn S Crossover trials in clinical research 2nd ed Chichester England John Wiley Sons 2002 As has been said a parallelgroups design can also be used in effective dose studies Assuming 3 doses for the active group and a standard deviation of the outcome eg pain score of 45 points with a minimal clinical important difference of 25 points we would need 54 patients in each group to ensure 80 power However titration assays are often done in twostage with a first randomization of patients on dose sequence and a second random allocation of patients to effective dose group or a placebo see eg Davis 1992 and the following illustration Twostage randomizationimg20130220114923png Free combination therapy is another topic where complex designs might be required factorial or response surface with quadratic terms added but it is generally found in preclinical studies67 Of note fixeddose combinations have been shown to perform usually better than freedrug combination especially in terms of

of a book that was updated on October 2015 The author assumes that data are managed using MS Excel and emphasizes the importance of quality control and data trails However I find this book a little scarce as it merely fly over the main points of data cleaning and in particular does not discuss technical issues except when suggesting some Excel function like TRIM or SUBSTITUTE By technical details I mean tabulating a categorical variable to check for duplicate or mispelled categories which is the only working case I happened to find in the book However this book is available for free and it will certainly help those who have no experience with data entry and data checking The author also developed the data kleenrhttpchi2innovationscomdatakleenr software Karl Broman also wrote a

much time to spend playing with the various examples However when you have a bit of knowledge of the commandline sedawk GNU coreutilshttpwwwgnuorgsoftwarecoreutils and UNIX philosophyhttpwwwfaqsorgdocsartuch01s06html its not hard to envision the power of a commandline approach to data analysis I often use a lot of small sed or awk onelinerhttpwwwosnewscomstory21004AwkandSedOneLinersExplained to perform basic operations on this blog John Chambers advocated long ago that many operations on text files can be handled with programs like sed awk or Perl Other than tabular CSV files many other data formats JSON XML etc can easily be handled by commandline utilities see Courseras Data Science Toolboxhttpswwwcourseraorgspecializationjhudatascience Chapter 3 on Getting and Cleaning Data or Paul Murrells online textbook on data technologies Sometimes I feel like I could take advantage of Rs powerful capabilities to perform data preprocessing and data cleansing but obviously this book makes strong arguments to perform such things directly from your Bash or zsh prompt The take away messages are simple 1 use small programs that do one thing well and handle STDINSTDOUT as expected 2 dont neglect old GNU softwaretheyve been developed twenty or thirty years ago and they work always as good as they used to work in the past 3 take a look at modern tools like csvkithttpscsvkitreadthedocsorgen090 4 think of UNIX pipes as a way of organizing your data workflow 5 be creative theres more than one way to do ithttpc2comcgiwikiThereIsMoreThanOneWayToDoIt Because I have nothing to do on this Sunday here is a simple illustration of using different programs to perform a very basic operation converting an SPSS file to CSV format Why this matters Well currently SPSS format is not easy to parse and eg Stata does not even provide a builtin reader Theres already a Perl programhttpczepnetdataspssread that allows to process SPSS files but if you already have R installed on your computer why not use it directly So lets say you just want to write an SPSS reader Lets try this first assuming your SPSS file is testsav Rscript e foreignreadspsstestsav todataframe TRUE testdat Now the file testdat looks like this head n 3 testdat ANY BORED CRITICS PEERS WRITERS DIRECTOR CAST 1 NO NO NO NO YES YES YES 2 YES YES NO YES YES YES YES To convert this file to a suitable CSV format we could do something like cat testdat tr s blank cut d f 28 tr upper lower testcsv The first command makes use of Rs foreign package to load the SPSS file and convert it to a data frame which is a simple rectagular array of records separated by TAB One minor annoyance with the generated testdat file is that it includes row names as consecutive integers in the first field Furthermore it is a good idea to convert spaces or TAB by comma to get a proper CSV file We then use tr for that purpose1 and cut to remove the first column Finally we again call tr to convert all records to lower case Of course this is just for the purpose of illustrating the use of tr cut and UNIX pipe Otherwise it is really much simpler to wrap the R command into writecsv file testcsv rownames FALSE Bioinformatics is also a domain where large amount of data are generated using various technologies SNPs short read etc and for which efficient solutions exist eg samtoolshttpwwwhtsliborg Although not mentioned in the book the available examples already provide a good idea of what can be done within the commandline and how tools like csvkithttpscsvkitreadthedocsorgen090 or GNU coreutils could be used to process or filter such kind of data Other commandline toolbox are worth mentioning though

network analysis and recommender systems Two extra chapters cover the basic of SQL and MapReduce Overall I find that the emphasis is put on applications and Python coding rather than using Python to solve data science problems A scratch course in Python is offered in Chapter 2 and the author suggests to install Anacondahttpcontinuumiodownloads as so many do I am however happy with the Python distribution that shipped with my Macbook that may be just me but Anaconda is creating a mess with various lib when using Homebrew and R I dont think this chapter would be enough for a beginner in Python though Likewise chapters on linear algebra and statistics are rather scarse even if chapter 7 Hypothesis and Inference discusses key elements of statistical inference The graphics arent so terrible because the author use Matplotlib with all its horrible default settings hopefully there are now bokehhttpbokehpydataorgenlatest and seabornhttpstanfordedumwaskomsoftwareseaborn Overall this book is for people who know Python and are interested into getting introduced to data science quickly without all the details The author is certainly very proficient in Python and he surely knows what he is doing when analyzing data but I was surprised to find so little discussion about statistical theory or data science as a whole As it stands this book looks more like a collection of recipes for data scientists interested in using Python Other titles of interest that I should probably describe in more details in future posts Data Science for Businesshttpwwwdatascienceforbizcom This book

Stephen Senn originally tackles common paradoxes in probability significance testing clinical trials bayesian vs frequentist school of inference and generalizability of results among others What is striking is that even if you are already familiar with those concepts it is carried away by the quality and rigor of the discussion Most of the time Senn starts by giving an historical overview of one

A final quote Statistics are and statistics is Statistics singular contrary to the popular perception is not really about facts it is about how we know or suspect or believe that something is a fact Because knowing about things involves counting and measuring them then it is true that statistics plural are part of the concern of statistics singular which is the science of quantitative reasoning This science has much more in common with philosophy in particular epistemology than it does with accounting Statisticians are applied philosophers Philosophers argue how many angels can dance on the head of a needle statisticians count them Or rather count how many can probably dance Probability is the heart of the matter the heart of all matter if the quantum physicists can be believed As far as

was thinking coming back to Lisp was no more than a bad joke Many of John Floyds courses are based on Lisp Stat Why is this so I think therere not in essence so much effective programming languages for computational statistics In reality the idea of a statistical programming language is not a new one and we can find great papers on that approach in the early 80s A wellknow example is the

by JM Chambers Now there is RhttpwwwRprojectorg which is supported by core members and a very active community of researchers The idea is that we really need an interactive shell and a true

Review of Psychology 2007 58 227257 This chapter reviews recent 20002005 personality disorder PD research focusing on three major domains assessment comorbidity and stability a Substantial evidence has accrued favoring dimensional over categorical conceptualization of PD and the fivefactor model of personality is prominent as an integrating framework Future directions include assessing dysfunction separately from traits and learning to utilize collateral information b To address the pervasiveness and extent of comorbidity researchers have begun to move beyond studying overlapping pairs or small sets of disorders and are developing broader more integrated commonfactor models that cross the Axis IAxis II boundary c Studies of PD stability have converged on the finding that PD features include both more acute dysfunctional behaviors that resolve in relatively short periods and maladaptive temperamental traits that are relatively more stablesimilar to normalrange personality traitswith increasing stability until after 50 years of age A new model for assessing PDand perhaps all psychopathologyemerges from integrating these interrelated reconceptualizations The next DSM should see the incorporation of the five factor model of personalityhttpenwikipediaorgwikiBigFivepersonalitytraits as well as the addition of a dimensional adjunct to each of the traditional categorical diagnoses of the DSM 1 There are many other issues that the DSM working groups wish to address including the revision of the hierarchical structure of the pure diagnostic categories because of the high rate of cooccurrence eg there exists a high comorbidity between generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder the frequent use of the not otherwise specified NOS label or the heterogeneous mix of conditions within current diagnostic boundaries 2 Also nowadays biological markers are increasingly used as predictive features or risk factors There clinical utility as diagnostic criteria as well as that of age gender and culturerelated specifiers should be fieldtested shortly As a sidenote the revision of the DSM wont solve the problem of causality as discussed by P Fayers in his papers on causal vs indicator variables 34 where the direction of causality is assumed to run from the construct to the indicators whence changes in the construct are expected to be manifested in changes in all indicators a multiitem scale is composed of Another good paper is 5 This reminds us of the causal networks consisting of symptoms and direct causal relations between discussed by Borsboom 67 However it is hoped that incorporating dimensional measures will facilitate the definition of more useful diagnostic categories by highlighting some dimensional discontinuities between disorders and clear thresholds between pathology and normality 2 Also the use of simple dimensional scales would obviously help to overcome the shopping list actually offered by the DSMIV which yield to an increased The idea of making a distinction between categorical attributes and unidimensional scales was also debated by Paul De Boeck during the IV EAM conference but see 8 A mustread for every psychometricians whether they are interested in diagnostic medicine or not According to De Boeck and coworkers the dimensional approach requires withincategory heterogeneity and betweencategory quantitative differences while the categorical approach suggests withincategory homogeneity and betweencategory qualitative differences Also an important point justifying their work on a DimensionCategory Framework DimCat is highlighted in the introduction emphasize is mine The issue under consideration here is whether the latent nature of manifest variables is categorylike or dimensionlike One assumption might be that the nature of the latent and manifest variables match As discussed below however manifest dimensions can be turned into manifest categories eg in segmentation into groups and manifest categories into manifest dimensions eg in sum scores on a test Thus the relations between different kinds of manifest variables and between different kinds of manifest and latent variables are not so simple as they might at first appear Consequently a conceptual and methodological framework that encompasses all of these possibilities is needed Well all that to say that diagnostic medicine will lead to many opportunities to develop innovative psychometrical models we should see an increasing interest in the identification of networks of comorbidities

displays for the moment Contingency tables as graphs Basically the idea is to show the relationships among categories of two or more variables arranged in a contingency table Then after realizing that a contingency table is nothing more than a weighted graph whose vertices are the categories and the edges are individual cells we can display it as we would do for a graph The trick is to impose some structure on the display and in fact it is easy to come to the idea that we can draw it in polar coordinates Lets look at an example First we generate some fake bivariate data r s cbindAsampleletters14 100 replaceTRUE Bsampleletters12 100 replaceTRUE stab tables1 s2 proptablestab or margintablestab c12 Now here is how it looks when we draw those linear relationships as ribbons whose size reflect conditional associations kaleid1img20110114142955png So far so good We got the idea but as we generate data from uniform distribution no relations are to be expected between the categories of A and B This is indeed the case and theres no apparent pattern in those ribbons and the points on the Asegment are evenly spaced So lets try with a more unbalanced twoway Table r s2 astablematrixc2314214225155 nc2 And here is flat display kaleid2img20110114152228png Clearly a more interesting pattern can be seen there First nearly all of the first category of A is linked to the first category of B Second this kind of picture clearly highlights closetoempty cells s231 and s212 Its quite easy to compare the above results with that obtained from a graphbased approach r

has been declared as native java class Hello public native void sayHello static SystemloadLibraryhello public static void mainString args Hello h new Hello hsayHello Next all we have to do is to call javah which will generate the C headers for us In fact the h file includes the C declarations for the methods that were declared native in our file java javah jni Hello ls Helloclass Helloh Hellojava The C side We now have three files and we can create a C file with the following code c include include include Helloh JNIEXPORT void JNICALL JavaHellosayHello JNIEnv env jobject obj printfHello worldn return It can be seen that we are passing the same parameters to the method as in the h file but now with names specified Now we have to compile our dynamic library thus we dont link the

summarize the introductory chapter which provides a nice overview of how ensemble methods work and why they are interesting from a predictive perspective bookimg20110819123038png As it is well known there is a large variety of DM algorithms whose predictive accuracy depends on the problem at hand Choosing the right algorithm we might even call this model selection provided we were to test several of them one against the other is then a matter of knowledge However there is a way to improve model accuracy that is easier and more powerful than judicious algorithm selection one can gather models into ensembles Useful references include Michie D Spielgelhalter DJ and Taylor CC 1994 Machine Learning Neural and Statistical Classificationhttpwwwamstaleedsacukcharlesstatlog New York Ellis Horwood Elder JF 1996 Heuristic search for model structure The benefits of restraining greed In D Fisher M Lenz Eds Learning from Data Artificial Intelligence and Statistics Chapter 13 New York SpringerVerlag Nisbet R Elder J and Miner G 2009 Handbook of Statistical Analysis Data Mining Applications Academic Press and some papers by Leo Breiman that I listed in another post The essential steps in building ensemble models are 1 constructing varied models and 2 combining their estimates The first step can be seen as a way to introduce some kind of variety or fluctuations in model outputs while the second step is a way to circumvent the decision of a single weak classifier by averaging over a collection of such decisions Note that we do not need to use the same model but different kind of classifiers might be combined Here is another and more complete definition by Nisbet et al pp 306307 To build ensembles you need to construct varied and accurate enough models and combine their estimates There are five ways to generate variability by modifying 1 Case weights as with boosting realvalued weights and bagging integer weights 2 Case valuesadding noise to the input or output variable values 3 Variable subsets as with random forests where each tree being built only considers for splitting a random subsetsay 10of the potential candidate inputs at any one node 4 Guiding parameters such as running an algorithm with different settings 5 Modeling technique eg tree regression MARS neural network There are three ways to combine estimates by using 1 Estimator weights perhaps based on estimated or training accuracy 2 Voting when the problem is predicting the best class 3 Partitions of the design space as with model gating where different models take control depending on which input space region we are in In our estimate the most common combination used is crossvalidation and averaging especially with decision trees That is building a model of one type on V different overlap ping folds of the data and then averaging the resulting estimates In our experience this and other variations are much more likely to help rather than hurt performance The authors cite illustrative examples of ensemble methods Bayesian model averaging which sums estimates of possible models weighted by their posterior evidence Bagging 1 where we bootstrap the training data set and the consider a majority vote or the average of model estimates Random Forest 23 which adds a stochastic component to create more diversity among the trees being combined AdaBoost 4 and ARCing 1 where models are built iteratively by varying case weights upweighting cases with large current errors and downweighting those accurately estimated and we use a weighted sum of the estimates of the sequence of models Gradient Boosting 56 which extends the AdaBoost algorithm to a variety of error functions for regression and classification Most of these algorithms are well explained in The Elements of Statistical LearninghttpwwwstatstanfordedutibsElemStatLearn by Hastie et al Less wellknown algorithms are the Group Method of Data HandlinghttpenwikipediaorgwikiGroupmethodofdatahandling GMDH 7 and its successor Polynomial Networks 89 where multiple layers of moderateorder polynomials fitted by linear regression are built by considering different variable sets to introduce variety An early related method Stackinghttpmachinelearningmartinsewellcomensemblesstacking was proposed by Wolpert 10 Another important aspect in model inference is regularization In effect it is generally advisable to favor both accuracy of predictions and simplicity of the model although there is a tradeoff between the two a flexible model will yield a higher accuracy but at the expense of possibly overfitting the data hence have poor generalizability performance Regularization offers a solution by penalizing model complexity through an error function that depends on the number of parameters in the model Common examples of such regularization techniques are the Lassohttpwwwstatstanfordedutibslassohtml 11 which inherits from Breimans work on the nonnegative Garotte estimator 12 or the LARShttpenwikipediaorgwikiLeastangleregression algorithm 13 Another one is the Path Seeker algorithm 14 which allows for a Lasso penalty with other loss functions Likewise the Generalized Path Seeker algorithm 15 extends the Elastic Net criterion 16 for producing sparse solution to nonconvex problems The conclusion of all studies done in this field of research is that generally bundling competing models into ensembles improves generalization The use of Generalized Degrees of Freedom 17 which is an empirical measure of the flexibility of the models allows to derive a measure of complexity

file is 22 Gb and contains 3956113 records The Stata file is more convenient since variables are already labelled and in the right format It is as easy to import a delimited text file than proprietary formats like Stata or SAS thanks to the havenhttphaventidyverseorg package It took about 23 min to preview and load the data in Exploratory on a Macbook Retina 12 running High Sierra with 8 Gb RAM the process eats up all my RAM due to other applications running in the background though Here are some benchmarks using more compared to base R readcsv function or less default options for

by Bength Muthnhttppagesgseisuclaedufacultymuthenmuthen3htm in the last 20 years Beside the equivalence between item parameters in those modelsdiscrimination IRT or loading FAanother concern in statistical modeling of individual responses to discrete items is that of the dimensionality of the scale Although there exist variants of IRT models to cope multiscale multiitems instruments the

test","tags":["statistics"],"href":"/fisher-test","content":"Here is an article published in Statistics in Medicine last year and that argues against the systematic use of Fishers exact test Since this is the test that is most of the times reported in clinical biostatistics and epidemiology articles lets look at the rationale behind this claim Lydersen S Fagerland MW and Laake P Recommended tests for association in 22 tableshttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed19170020 Statistics in Medicine 2009 28 11591175 Below is the abstract of the article by Lydersen and coll The asymptotic Pearsons chisquared test and Fishers exact test have long been the most used for testing association in 22 tables Unconditional tests preserve the significance level and generally are more powerful than Fishers exact test for moderate to small samples but previously were disadvantaged by being computationally demanding This disadvantage is now moot as software to facilitate unconditional tests has been available for years Moreover Fishers exact test with midp adjustment gives about the same results as an unconditional test Consequently several better tests are available and the choice of a test should depend only on its merits for the application involved Unconditional tests and the midp approach ought to be used more than they now are The traditional Fishers exact test should practically never be used The chisquare and Fishers test First of all lets recall whats the difference between Fishers test and the standard 2 test Basically Pearsons 2 reads as the suqared differences between observed and expected counts divided by expected counts to get a convenient normalization Under the hypothesis of no association ie statistical independence between row and column totals the socalled margins the expected count of nij is simply the product of its corresponding totals ni and nj Under a large sample hypothesis the observed 2 statistic follow a 21 distribution It generalizes to IxJ Tables where the degree of freedom is I1J1 The Fishers test is an exact test relying on the hypergeometric distribution where all possible Tables having the same marginal totals are computed It is a computer intensive job and in R fishertest it is relegated to a C function It is important to recall that Fishers test assumes that margins are fixed whereas Pearsons 2 might be used to test either independence or homogeneity of proportions when one marginal total is fixed A more comprehensive framework is provided in Sokal and Rohlf1 p 721 and ff They consider three different kind of sampling schemes or designs named Model I II and III depending on whether the totals in the margins of the 2x2 Table are fixed by the investigator or are free to vary and reflect population parameters Model I considers all Tables with the same total sample size n an alternative model I is where the same individuals are assessed two timesbut the hypothesis to be tested is clearly different Model II considers that one of the margin totals is fixed Model III considers that both margin totals are fixed The Fishers test is appropriate for Model III design The Gtest of independence is designed for the other two models The Gtest is a likelihood ratio test whose expression might be derived from multinomial expectations p 692 as G2sumi1afilnleftfracfihat firight ie it summarizes the sum of the independent contributions of departures from expectations ln weighted by the frequency of the particular class fi It is approximately 21 distributed About Yates correction The Yates continuity correction consists in subtracting 05 from the difference between each observed value and its expected value in 22 table only1 Yates correction is known to result in tests that are more conservative as with Fishers exact tests However we can read in Agresti CDAhttpwwwstatufleduaacdacdahtml 2002 p 103 that Yates 1934 mentioned that Fisher suggested the hypergeometric to him for an exact test He proposed a continuitycorrected version of 2 chic2sumsumfracleftmid nijhatmuijmid 05right2hatmuij to approximate the exact test Since software now makes Fishers exact test feasible even with large samples this correction is no longer needed There is an excellent tutorial by Jerry Dallal on Contingency TableshttpwwwjerrydallalcomLHSPctabhtm and the same remark is made Continuitycorrected chisquare are useless when it comes to approximate Fisher exact test now that the latter is readily available in any statistical software Dallal considers the following example r tab matrixc83510 nr2

test are in close agreement The LRT Gtest would yield 2140573 p00440 It is available through assocstats from the vcdhttpcranrprojectorgwebpackagesvcdindexhtml package The midp approach TODO In summary All of the above would lead to the following practical considerations For large sample or Tables satisfying Cochrans rule1 use uncorrected chisquare test45 Otherwise use Fishers test See also AssumptionsRestrictions for Chisquare Tests on Contingency TableshttpssitesgooglecomalakeheaducabweaverHomestatisticsnoteschisqrassumptions by Bruce Weaver Campbell6 discussed the use of Fishers test in lieu of the usual chisquare test but see his associated website on Two by two Tableshttpwwwiancampbellcouktwobytwotwobytwohtm As quoted on this website the following rules are recommended Where all expected numbers are at least 1 analyse by the N 1 chisquared test the K Pearson chisquared test but with N replaced by N 1 Otherwise analyse by the FisherIrwin test with twosided tests carried out by Irwins rule taking tables from either tail as likely or less as that observed Back to Lydersen et coll In their article Lydersen et coll said that as a conditional test Fishers test may be replaced by

as manifestations of the hypothetized construct whose variations are directly reflected in items responses items are exchangeable and any one can be safely removed without altering the construct The former obviously subsumes an idea of causality while the latter more or less resembles what we find in most unidimensional measurement scale in medical science How we treat items will have consequence on the choice of an appropriate model formative items are assumed to be measured without error whcih is not the case for reflective items but also on the interpretation of the results An example of formative and reflexive constructs is shown in the following picture pathimg20111211213531png However I should note that the above controversy has also been discussed in older papers dealing with the assessment of healthrelated quality of life I am thinking of two papers by Peter Fayers which are Fayers PM and Hand DJ 2002 Causal variables indicator variables and measurement scales an example from quality of life Journal of the Royal Society A 1652 233261 Fayers PM 2004 QualityofLife Measurement in Clinical TrialsThe Impact of Causal Variableshttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed15027506 Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics 141 155176 In the second paper it is said that some items are essentially causal variables and this explains the seemingly strange results that have been observed by those who have previously compared the psychometric and clinimetric approach p 157 Indicator variables do not alter or influence the underlying concept but rather appear to be aspects of the construct or indicator of its magnitude Causal variables can cause the outcome to vary and need to be present for the construct to manifest itself The author illustrates this view with the example of symptoms Many HRQL scales include symptoms because they are part of what consitutes HRQL good HRQL means the absence of pain or other severe symptoms but symptoms do not reflect a patients HRQL there is no indication that patients with a poor HRQOL are likely to suffer all symptoms although if they are present score highly say then the patients HRQOL is reduced Furthermore the more diseasespecific a questionnaire is the more likely it is to contain such questions as important items So clearly the relationship between the construct being measured and the manifest variables does not go in the same direction in both cases About interitem correlation it is noted that correlations arise from symptom clusters associated with the disease or treatment process and are indicators of the status of disease but not of HRQOL More importantly causal variables cannot be conditionnally independent of each other with respect to the construct under investigation As a thought test Peter Fayers summarizes the following conditions Does increase in item X eg pain indicate reduction in HRQL For reflective and formative items the answer is Yes Does reduction in HRQL imply increase in X The answer might be Yes but only for reflective items But lets note that in practice many clinical variables will be of intermediate type That means that psychometric methods should be used with caution which reminds of Borsboom 2006 who rightly said that This is a psychometric embarrassment of riches Even within this concise set of questions to be answered we encounter no less than four radically different conceptualizations of the relation between conscientiousness and conscientious behaviors a universesampling relation generalizability theory a formative causal relation formative model a reflective causal relation with the latent variable categorical latent class model and a reflective causal relation with the latent variable continuous IRT Moreover as the IRT example shows within each of these conceptualizations there are many more finegrained choices to be made before we truly have a candidate model Literally none of these choices are dictated by substantive theory p 435 Sidenote At a more general level the concept of causality in HRQL outcome studies has been discussed by Wilson and Clearly in the following paper Wilson IB and Cleary PD 1995 Linking clinical variables with healthrelated quality of life A conceptual model of patient outcomes JAMA 273 5965 This has led to this wellknown outline of HRQL key constructs and their relationships

Pandochttpjohnmacfarlanenetpandoc and slides are formatted using gorgeous themes Decksetimg20140816125335png Slides are rendered as you type your Markdown slides which is pretty handy and figures can be displayed in different manner fit to screen left or rightaligned filtered or at a specific of the original size Any editor that supports Markdown editing well basically all text editors can be used which means that I can write in Emacs In fact Deckset is better described as a presenter not an authoring tool Unlike Pandoc it is a paid application available on the AppStore It is something to consider if you are happy with Keynotes or Beamer Illustration In what follows I will use some materials I wrote for a training in Biostatistics with Rhttpwwwaliquoteorgcours2012biomed Initially I used a combination of Pandoc and a custom Beamer template to process a set of Markdown files with a bit of pure LaTeX instructions though This way I was able to focus on the content rather than the layout It took me some time however to get the definitive lookandfeel that I was looking for If you are interested see my beamerlatexhttpaliquoteorgpubbeamerlatex template and the

LatohttpswwwgooglecomfontsspecimenLato fonts Some remarks I had to split some of the slides into two or more slides because of the default font for the theme I choose Theres probably a way to change the font size but it looks pretty good as it stands Also Deckset automatically scale down blocks of code when there is not enough free space on the slide This is another reason to break down the original layout Unfortunatly Deskset is not able to render LaTeX mathematical symbols using MathJax at the moment Deckset doesnt seem to like Emacs autofill very much like Markedapphttpmarked2appcom in fact and I had to unfill all paragraphs in the original Markdown file Pros and cons On the Pro side Desckset is easy to use and it provides live preview much like Apple Keynote It further allows to write down in Markdown which is pretty good and it has builtin syntax highlighting for many programming languages Finally images are handled very decently although not shown above If you like textbased editing doesnt care about complex layouts which might be a good idea for visual presentation after all and do not make heavy use of mathematical notation then Deckset is worth to take a look

is that you get autocompletion when you are typing into the REPL For example lets write a function x rightarrow x2 lisp defun square x x x We could also use def square lambda x x x As soon as you start typing defun youll get this nice prompt for name and argument img20110131163408png Lets again introduce an error when typing the function definition say we wrote x x instead of x x Here is what

The GRADE methodology is fully described on It is used to summarize the evidence extracted from systematic reviews and metaanalyses and grading the quality of evidence and strength of treatment recommendations gathered from them It is distinct from a metaanalysis as it does not focus on the estimation of treatment effects or other statistical related stuff The GRADE approach considers that the following factors should be met before claiming any evidence regarding treatment effect in clinical guidelines Box 3 from Barbui et al 2010 Study limitations Limitations in the study design that may bias the overall estimates of the treatment effect Inconsistency Unexplained differing estimates of the treatment effect size ie heterogeneity or variability in results across studies Indirectness The question being addressed by the guideline panel is different from the available evidence regarding the population intervention comparator or outcome Imprecision Results are imprecise when studies include relatively few patients and few events and thus have wide confidence intervals around the estimate of the effect Publication bias Systematic underestimate or overestimate of the underlying beneficial or harmful effect due to the selective publication or reporting of studies Ansari et al2 argue however that Recommendations based on the GRADE approach specifically apply to clinical and

style","tags":["psychometrics"],"href":"/handling-extreme-response-style","content":"Following a response I gave on statsstackexchangecomhttpstatsstackexchangecom about the analysis of respondents who always answer the most extreme responses I finally decided to investigate this topic with greater care See the full threadhttpstatsstackexchangecomquestions2374likertscalesanalysis My main points were that FA applies for attitude items as it does for other kind of measurement instrument although treating Likert items as continuous data is a longstanding debate Other models IRT SEM etc apply as well Now the fact that some respondents may systematically highlight an extreme response style that is they always select the response categories on the extreme of the scale eg totally agree or totally disagree may strongly bias items parameters whether it be loadings or difficulty Background Ceiling and floor effects are wellknow effects in quality of life reports They simply reflect the fact that most of the times people are wellbeing to a few exceptions those patients that are really sick or are truly depressed for example Usually these items are removed from the scale because they carry very little information in other words they have a very low discriminative power although they may seem to enhance scale reliability through their systematic high correlation with summated scale score This phenomenon generally results from a large proportion of respondents which differs from cheating effects or things like that which are generally the results of minority of subjects And this latter case is the one that seems to be of interest here Now the point is that most of psychometric approaches for constructing scale focus at the item level ceilingfloor effect decreased reliability bad item fit statistics etc but when one is interested in how people deviate from what would be expected from an ideal set of observersrespondents I think we must focus on person fit indices instead Such 2 statistics are readily available for IRT models like INFIT or OUTFIT mean square but generally they apply on the whole questionnaire Moreover since estimation of items parameters rely in part on persons parameters eg in the marginal likelihood framework we assume a gaussian distribution the presence of outlying individuals may lead to potentially biased estimates and poor model fit As proposed by Eid and Zickar 2007 combining a latent class model to isolate group of respondents eg those always answering on the extreme categories vs the others and an IRT model to estimate item parameters and persons locations on the latent trait in both groups appears a nice solution Other modeling strategies are described in their paper eg HYBRID model see also Holden and Book 2009 Likewise unfolding modelshttpwwwpsychologygatecheduunfoldingpublicationshtml may be used to cope with response style which is defined as a consistent and contentindependent pattern of response category eg tendency to agree with all statements In the social sciences or psychological literature this is know as Extreme Response Style ERS References 13 may be useful to get an idea on how it manifests and how it may be measured Detecting perfect scores Hereafter I am interested in showing how a subsample of extreme respondents might impact the quality of the underlying scale I shall assume a unidimensional construct for the sake of simplicity But it should easily extend to the case of multiscale questionnaire Rather than simulating response to Likert item not so easy in fact I will just use data on attitude to the environment included in the ltm package The data set N291 is comprised of a set of six items coded on a threepoint scale11 1 LeadPetrol Lead from petrol 2 RiverSea River and sea pollution 3 RadioWaste Transport and storage of radioactive waste 4 AirPollution Air pollution 5 Chemicals Transport and disposal of poisonous chemicals 6 Nuclear Risks from nuclear power station which I happen to load as follows r dataEnvironment packageltm applyEnvironment 2 functionx tablexsumtablex About 10 of the respondents N30 were selected at random and get a 0 score meaning not very concerned Given that the majority of answers are on the other extreme of the scale between 52 and 80 this may be seen as a cluster of atypical individuals who are saying they are not concerned while most of people generally agree that such factor might have a great impact on the environment r erssubj sample1nrowEnvironment 30 Envnum sapplyEnvironment asnumeric Envnumerssubj 2 We can check that the scale is unidimensional which would otherwise not motivate the use of an unidimensional IRT model This is roughly checked from the distribution of the eigenvalue computed through an PCA where we superimposed those coming from random data The picture below clearly suggest that unidimensionality holds img20100912170857png I initially thought of estimating person parameters using the eRm package12 because it has a nice interface and offers several model to handle polytomous items partial credit and rating scale models However estimation is based on CML and person parameters are not computed for socalled zero or perfect scores Hence I have to rely on MML and I choose to base my analysis on the Graded Response Model GRM with items considered as equally

Psychometrics by Paul Kline here is a review of Intelligence The Psychometric View first published in 1991 I must admit I read it in two days partly because I was on holidays and spent much more time enjoying the sun and swimming pool near Bordeaux France 33 but also because it is so much well written that there is no need to retrace ones steps Here a couple of quotes that I would like to comment on when I come back to this review Emphasizes are mine The relation of these two intelligence factors is highly revealing and it has been explicated in considerable detail both theoretically and empirically by Cattell 1971 under the name of investment theory which can be briefly summarized In this theory it is claimed that there develops a single general relationperceiving ability which is connected to the total associational neuronal development of the cortex This is fluid ability which is obviously highly heritable Crystallised ability on the other hand develops as a result of investing fluid ability in particular learning experiences Thus at an early age say 2 or 3 years fluid ability and crystallised ability are highly correlated As children grow older and undergo different experiences at school and in the family so clearly fluid ability and crystallised ability become less highly correlated The bright and welladjusted child who attends a good school and receive encouragement at home will invest most of her fluid ability in the crystallised skills of her culture On the other hand the equally bright child from a home where education is not valued and who attends a school of indifferent quality will not thus invest his fluid ability His school performance may be far worse than a moderate child who invests all his ability at school p 34 This somewhat echoes what is traditionnaly observed in behavior genetics namely that the influence of genes is higher in the early stages of development whereas external factors may overcome their effect with environmental exposure It is not correct as Spearman claimed that human ability should be conceptualised in terms of one general factor intelligence together with a number of specifics This picture is too simple Rather we should see human ability as encapsulated by five factors the second orders which have been described Of these however two highly correlated factors are by far the most important fluid and crystallised ability the latter the cultural emanation of the former Fluid ability is essentially a basic reasoning ability necessary for problem solution on a wide variety of problems and highly heritable being dependant on neuronal efficiency These two intelligence factors are Spearmans g split by more efficient factor analysis Thus in summary Cattells delineation of the structure of ability is an amplification of that of Spearman p 36 According to Cattells work12 the five secondorder factors are Fluid intelligence Crystallised intelligence Visualisation Retrieval capacity or general fluency Cognitive speed factor References 1 Horn J and Cattell RB 1966 Refinement and test of the theory of fluid and crystallised intelligence Journal of Educational Psychology 57

2003 Interaction terms in logit and probit modelshttpwwwunceduenortonAiNortonpdf Economics Letters 80 123129 The magnitude of the interaction effect in nonlinear models does not equal the marginal effect of the interaction term can be of opposite sign and its statistical significance is not calculated by standard software We present the correct way to estimate the magnitude and standard errors of the interaction effect in nonlinear models The main ideas of this article is that both the test and interpretation of an interaction term in a GLM are done in the wrong way Instead of interpreting the true interaction coefficient discussion often relies on the marginal effect of the interaction term What are marginal effect In this context it means that an interaction between two factors should be combined with the main effects marginal to that interaction68 Using the notation of the authors the interaction effect is the cross derivative of the expected value of y fracpartial Phicdotpartial

In addition the authors highlight the fact that the interaction effect might be not negligible even if the corresponding beta 0 Further the interaction effect is conditional on the independent variables Finally the sign of the interaction term does not necessarily indicate the sign of the interaction effect as it may have different signs for different values of the covariates Altogether these remarks should give support to the practitioner so that a careful examination of the model fit is done before concluding or interpreting the interaction effect without caution Whats about the computation of the oddsratio associated to the main effects when the interaction is significant For instance consider a logistic framework with two main effects say beta1 and beta2 and a third coefficient beta12 that represents the interaction For the purpose of the illustration we can easily imagine two such factors eg the smoking status smoker or not and the drinking status occasional vs regular drinker The response variable might be any medical outcome of potential interest cancer malignant affection etc coded as a binary 01 variable If the interaction is significant then talking about the oddsratio OR associated to the smoking variable has no sense at all Instead one must describe two OR the OR for subjects who are smoker but occasional drinker expbeta1 and the OR for subjects who are smoker and regular drinker expbeta1 beta12 The two authors hold the necessary StataStata code on their homepage However I would like to illustrate the issues raised by the interpretation of interaction terms when using nonlinear models with RR The effects package facilitates in some way the graphical display of effects sizes and we will use it in the short application

After having read the first two chapters I wonder How come I didnt start with that book when I was studying elementary statistics I recently had to give a short series of lectures on statistics at a very introductory level where I started with an illustration of a coin tossing experimenthttpwwwaliquoteorgcours2011healthmeasures02biostatisticsscreenpdf starting at slide 7 Well now that I have read Kiefers first chapter I feel like the takeaway message was already there A typical problem in probability theory is of the following form A sample space and underlying function are specified and we are asked to compute the probability of a given chance event In a typical problem of statistics it is not a single underlying probability law which is specified but rather a class of laws any of which may possibly be the one which actually governs the chance device or experiment whose outcome we shall observe We know that the underlying probability law is a member of this class but we do not know which one it is The object might then be to determine a good way of guessing on the basis of the outcome of the experiment which of the possible underlying probability laws is the one which actually governs the experiment whose outcome we are to observe and the ensuing discussion including chapter 2 drives the reader toward the specification of a statistical problem based on a simple coin

conferencehttpwwwiscb2010info I only attended the first two days with sessions mostly oriented toward genetic epidemiology An extra session around latent variable modeling was also present This gives me the opportunity to summarize two aspects of statistical modeling that I actually like a lot namely biometrics and psychometrics The sequential rejection principle of familywise error control A Solari In the context of GWAS where we usually work with 500000 SNPs or more and where each SNP represents one hypothesis to test the nominal pvalue would have to be set to 1e7 Even if SNPs are grouped by chromosomal region we still have very low pvalue p regions tested There is thus a compromise between an increase in power by working at a higher level than single unit eg region or chromosome and an increase in statement However the problem with regionbased testing is that if H0 is to be rejected we cannot say in turn which of its SNPs isare implicated in the uncovered association There comes graphstructured hypothesis whereby hypotheses are arranged in a tree structure based on 1 prior biological knowledge Fig 1a 2 logical relationship Fig 1b or 3 a data driven principle eg linkage disiquilibrium img20100831214719png The sequential rejection principle states that if one hypothesis is rejected then we might update the reamining ones and set a new critical level for unrejected hypothesis Goeman and Solari1 use this method throughout their inheritance procedure but basically it derives from Meinshausen8217s procedure2 if hypothesis are arranged in a tree criticals levels are found to be equal to alpha letters leaves Figure 2 shows an example of how hypotheses and critical levels are processed img20100831215539png In the latest case on the right if AB is rejected then it follows that both A and B critical levels are alpha x 25 since if AB is false we know that at least one of A or B is false The authors then illustrate their testing procedure using a small data set of SNPs but basically it is what is implemented in the globaltest R package So in what follows I just try to mimic their example from the online help It is to be noted that a permutation test is used to assess if the incorporation of structure information increases statistical power I wonder how such resampling procedure might be tuned to handle large real data sets with

adjustment for multiplicity J Berger He gave a nice talk about problem frequently encountered in the USA with the results reproducibility As an example he provides the following numbers for clinical trials during phase I there are 8 of chance for reaching market whereas it was 14 15 years ago there is actually a 70 of failure rates in phase III whereas it was 20 10 years ago reports where 30 of phase III successes are observed actually failed to replicate This motivating illustrations shouod alert the reader that too many RCTs failed to reach a statisfactory level of evidence and this may largely due to problem with multiple comparisons Bayesian analysis deals with adjustment for multiplicity of testing solely through the assignement of prior probabilities to models or hypotheses If we note Xi sim Nmu 1 i 1 dots m a set of predictors whose correlation is rho then two cases can be distinguished based on the value of rho if rho 0 independent case then we can set the critical level at

originally included 780k SNPs subsequently pruned to a set of almost independent 74062 SNPs based on LD The problem with GWAS is that we expect very few true associations so most significant results are false positives The FDR is usually about 100 so it is not an interesting measure The idea is rather to estimate the number of true discoveries Sc Rcmc where m is the number of SNPs and Rc is the number of SNPs where p c In this case mc is approximately the number of top SNPs The question then arises as to how we get a confidence band for Sc Using a permutation test based on casecontrol labels yields a pvalue but not CIs However CIs can be derived from the percentile of Sstarc if we assume a logical requirement of monotonicity But it generates a substantial bias of the same order as the

Submitted to Ann Statist available on arXiv 09081767httparxivorgabs09081767 Discovering gene networks using L1 and L0 penalties J de Rooi Considering the huge amount coming from gene expression studies the natural question that comes to mind is What does the dependency structure among the genes look like One way to answer this question is to use Graphical Models A good starting point on GGM is Introduction to Graphical Modelling from D Edwards Springer 2000 or the ggmhttpcranrprojectorgwebpackagesggm package They have been successfully used by Krmer et al1 who also authored the parcorhttpcranrprojectorgwebpackagesparcor package Several approaches were already described including 1 topology models 2 control logic models or 3 dynamic models The authors focused on the first approach which aims to identify modules and hubs in the underlying graph Modules allow to model the strongest dependencies among the genes and to obtain a sparse representation in turn When p n the covariance matrix is illconditioned or singular so it calls for penalized regression Basically we fit p regression models and look at the partial correlation coefficient defined as rhoijcdot ztextsignbetaijsqrtbetaijbetaji which is 0 if textsignbetaijtextsignbetaji This is a smooth approximation to the L0 penalty So we start fitting a model with L1 penalty then we use its final estimates as starting points for L0 penalization The whole procedure is encompassed within a crossvalidation procedure Results on simulated random or structured networks are compared to existing methods such as PLS2 L1 regression3 adjustedL1 regression4 and PCIT5 Overall the results showed that PLS and PCIT generate many false positives and that both aL1 and L0 returned the highest precision L0 tend to create large bias in terms of MSE In conclusion the aL1 method seems to be the best method 1 N Kraemer J Schaefer AL Boulesteix 2009 Regularized estimation of largescale gene regulatory networks using

should be used for descriptive purpose only assessing distribution characteristics identifying gap in construct coverage With such low sample size it is diffuclt to provide a clear picture of reliability dimensionality content saturation using itemperson map and validity However the idea is that gaps along the continuum at the level of item and response scale interval could be assessed

assessing nonverbal intellectual capacity on 35 children with the help of 18 items from the Know Cubes test Regarding sample size in IRT With binary items for a precision of 05 logit and 95 confidence sample size is int he order of 64144 with 99 confidence it raises to 108243 With polytomous items we need at least 10 observations per category for the Rating Scale Model and 100 reponses per item may

admit I have hard time imagining how we can use 30 individuals to fit a Rasch model beside unreliable parameters estimates we would just not have enough coverage of the latent trait with such a small sample size so the last talk by Kathleen Wyrwuch was somehow wholesome Utility measures Beside deriving utility index for use in costeffectiveness studies utility measures are also frequently encountered in studies where researchers want to map two instruments scores This often is a more difficult task when dealing with condition specific measure or clinical measures of severity vs a generic instrument In her talk Appropriate mapping functions in HRQL a series of models mapping from FACTG to EQ5D Tracey A Young provided a gentle overview of several competing models that could be used to map a diseasespecific instrument 27 items covering 4 dimensions onto the EQ5D 3level utility scores The following approaches were discussed OLS Tobit twopart models splining response mapping censored absolute deviance generalised linear model Model performance can be assessed using several criteria MAE AIC BIC shrinkage adjusted or pseudo R squared It appears that OLS predictions overestimate scores for people in low health state but were quite good around average health states A Tobit model appears to provide the best estimate across all criteria while response mapping gave poorest estimate due to the nature of the data 530 patients in stage 34 in the USA with few responders in poor health The next talk was about comparing 3 vs 5level response options for the EQ5D questionnaire in sample of spanish urological cancer patients It is wellknown that the EQ5D exhibits strong ceiling effect in the general population 4765 depending on studies as well as in specific pathologies cancer 27 CVD 20 chronic bronchitis 23 The authors added two intermediate levels so that response categories were no slight moderate severe extreme problems Patients N840 were surveyed at baseline and 6 months after and version administration was counterbalanced Performance was assed by analyzing redistribution of the response categories between the two versions using Shannon indexes Item response curves computed from an IRT model 2 factors were also used The results suggest that adding two response options increased informativity except for the selfcare dimension while ceiling effects keep relevant for the pathology under study Last talk I attended was about the use of discrete choice model in quantifying healthstates for the new EQ5D5L by Paul FM Krabbe It was an enlightening talk because the author discussed the valuation or index approach as opposed to the classical test or item response theory which is frequently used in economics or psychometrics and shed light on the connection between psychophysics and psychometrics Indeed the basic element of measurement is a comparison between two or more entities or stimuli References were made to Gustav Fechner and Thurstones law of comparative judgement Discrete choice analysis goes back to the work of Luce Manski and Lerman McFadden and Louviere et al Part of this original work was published as Stolk EA

session concentrated on what the team achieved in terms of defining minimum standards For whatever reasons I havent been in touch with the progress on this I suspect this is because ISOQOL forgot I registered two years ago to the psychometrics SIG Anyway I was a little bit disappointed by what seems to emerge as minimum standards for PRO measurement the overwhelming reliance on Cronbachs alpha above 07 in most settings and correlational approaches to convergent and divergent validity suggests no one will move toward more refined structural approaches factor analysis structural equation modeling IRT modeling Moreover to my great surprise there was no mention of measurement invariance which in my view greatly limit inference drawn on scale scores Finally it was not very clear to me what minimum standards would be for PRO studies with children as a target population Indeed the proposed age limit 12 years and grade level for litteracy leave pediatric studies in the dark regarding what minimum standards could be Yet it is a good idea to define a common framework with wellacknowledged landmarks for analysing PRO data Analysis and interpretation of outcomes HRQL values from a background population may be used as a proxy for true baseline HRQL which allows to obtain matched HRQL mean reference scores MRS This study used the Swedish esophageal and cardia cancer database I believe these slideshttpbitlySgaUPC refer to the same target population The reference population was composed of a random sample of persons aged between 40 and 79 Matching 971 was done on age gender and comorbidities CVD diabetes KD asthma and others Linear mixed models were used to analyse the effects of comorbidities on longitudinal recovery of HRQL functional and symptoms scales Results showed that patients with comorbidities had worse baseline scores and lower MRS scores The next talk was on Differential Item Functioning analysis of the Spanish item bank of the PROMIS Pain Behaviorhttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed19683873 See herehttpbitlyVuC5DF for the complete list of items Translation of item bank followed the FACIT protocolhttpbitlyVuC96m 2 forward 1 backward translations expert reviews and 5 cognitive interviews per item A total of 527 spanishspeaking and 678 englishspeaking USA patients were enrolled A graded response model was used to with assessment of dimensionality and local dependence Confirmatory factor analysis was done with Mplus and the authors considered a scree plot as well as the maximum absolute residual correlation no local dependence was present except for two items with the IRTFIT Macrohttpoutcomescancergovareasmeasurementirtfiteulahtml Finally the LORDIFhttpwwwjstatsoftorgv39i08paper R package was used for DIF analysis 7 items were collapsed from 6 to 5 categories and 1 item from 6 to 4 categories due to response distribution imbalance The results highlighted 6 items which were found to exibit significant DIF effect between the two groups of respondents Following on earlier workhttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed22069169 on power analysis for Rasch modeling published in Statistics in Medicine Hardouin and coll presented a new simulation studies on power determination with varying distribution shape of abilities and an expected difference in mean trait scores There exist both a Stata module raschpowerhttpideasrepecorgcbocbocodes457106html and an online platformhttpraschonlineunivnantesfr Im not sure to understand why the authors considered a Ushaped Beta distribution for trait levels in this new simulation study since this amounts to consider that there may be high ceiling and floor effects and that items in the middle range of the scale could not be reliably estimated unless the instrument is already calibrated Last talk I attended on Friday 26 was about the use of propensity score matching to deal with possible selection bias any betweengroup imbalance in pretreatment

words about it img9781449332310gif First of all it should be noted that it is not Dave Taylors first try at writing a book on OS X and Darwin but most of the previous incantations are now out of print Dave Taylor designed the Elmhttpwwwinstinctorgelm email client in the 90s well before Mutthttpwwwmuttorg and other textbased email software TLDR This book is a very interesting take for two kind of people those who would like to get a better understanding of the commandline in general andor OS X internals and those who would like to work using the commandline in addition to the OS X standard applications like the Finder to improve their productivity In the later case one of the best use case is certainly the combined use of Spotlights mdls which return file metadata find and grep See the end of Chapter 5 to learn more At first sight it really looks like a book for people not familiar with Unix or Linux systems and who know close to nothing to the commandline or what the difference between a shell a terminal and a TTY is1 Even so there is always something to learn along the way I for myself learned some cool options about BSD command I used to use almost every day For instance I was remembered that ls s indicates the size of files in units of 512 bytes rather than 1024 bytes since I always use ls l aliased to ll I totally forgot about this peculiarity Somehow I also forgot about the UsersShared directory that any user can use to store or write personal files that can be shared with but not overwritten by other users of the system2 Things get more interesting with Chapter 4 since the author starts using the command line more often to show how to deal with files using ls less and cat grep globalregular expressionprint more on this in Chapter 5 cp and mv ln gunzip tar With no surprise the author choose to use vi rather than Emacs to illustrate basic text processing since it is available on Unx machine including OS X Although I am definitely not a Vim power user but I do know how to quit Vimhttpstwittercomiamdevloperstatus435555976687923200 I found the instructions clear and instructive Regarding Emacs the author qualifies it as the Ferrari of Unix text editors Chapter 5 is all about finding stuff on your Mac whether it be files or simple pattern to lookup in one or several files Mac users are probably used to Spotlight and maybe its capabilities to exploit file tpe and metadata see man mdls and man mdfindthis works great on PDF and Media file3 but it is quite simple to use grep or ackhttpsbeyondgrepcom with powerful regular expressions find or may be locate Since find doesnt know how to open files but just test file attributes it is often combined with xargs to apply a specific command to each result Here are some funny examples built on top of those proposed by the author find usrbin name c size 30k type f user USER perm uw print will find regular files starting with c that are executable greater than 30 KB in size located in the bin directory and for which you write permission find cmin 60 print type f xargs grep i TODO find TODO items case insensitive in plain files that have changed within 60 minutes in the current directory Surely the interested reader will find additional goodies on bashonelinerscomhttpwwwbashonelinerscom or other oneliner website In Chapter 6 the author deals with redirecting standard input and output which extends the piping operations discussed in the preceding chapters and applies to lineoriented program as opposed to screenoriented program per the author distinction The combination of pipe output redirection or append to write to an output file helps to define socalled filter Several utilities are discussed to illustrate this approach to restructure the output of a series of commands tr wc head and tail sort uniq4 Again here are two examples from the author find type f user USER print0 xargs 0 ls s1 sort rn head This will return the largest files owned by you in the current directory tr cs alpha n alicetxt tr AZ az sort uniq wc l This will count the number of distinct words used in Alices Adventures in Wonderland available in plain

returns information about the creator and type codes of a given file Type codes are four characters long and define which icon gets assigned to certain files and more importantly determine the default application for opening that file This was a good read Meanwhile things have changed a bit on OS X the ftp command no longer exists in High Sierra the X11 server has been replaced by XQuartz and much

software","tags":["psychometrics"],"href":"/linear-programming-with-gnu-software","content":"In my daily job Im involved in a project around adaptive testing Basically items are presented in an order that is dependent upon the estimated level of ability of the respondent Parameters estimation can be done on the fly time consuming or can rely on more subtle computation based on overall test information and additional constraints distributed content or thematics etc Moreover items can be collapsed into socalled items bundles Taking into account such constraints during the building up of items sequence calls for linear programming ressources However it has been shown that linear programming models are not always applicable as some constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously with some other constraints Most of the initial work on tailored testing in educational measurement has been pioneered by ETSETS researchers12 Swanson and Stocking propose to use a weighted deviation model relying on LP with several constraints for the selection of items Such constraints generally involve maximization of item information restriction to selected topics or distributed content minimization of item exposure etc In this view these constraints shall be viewed as desirable properties rather than external conditions Of course bayesian techniques3 have been proposed as well An online tutorialonline tutorial is available on Lawrence M Rudners website Note also that applications embedding a CAT approach dont restrict to education but also covered wide biomedical assessments4 While I was looking for LP facilities within R I found three related packages see the CRANCRAN website for details glpk Rglpk and linprog The former rely on the GNU Linear Programming KitLinear Programming Kit while the linprog package implements the simplex algorithm for solving linear optimisation problems I know there is also LP tools with the MatlabMatlab optimization toolbox but I dont use Matlab since I left my previous lab However I found a free implementation when googling for LP code linprogmlinprogm It is Octavecompatible and I happen to test it using a very simple problem Before starting with R I take a look at GLPK on GNU websiteGNU website Starting using these tools was a little confusing as it is not a standalone C program taking as argument matrices and vectors describing the linear system as usual but the program glpsol relies on an external description file Hereafter is a little demonstration of its use Before that we have to talk about the underlying modeling language which is derived from the original AMPLAMPL language A free chapterfree chapter of the official AMPL book is available to download At a glance GLPK can handle several kind of problems using simplex method primaldual interior point method branchandbound method There are also some additional facilities translation from GNU MathProgMathProg API standalone LPMIP solver GNU MathProg is a subset of the AMPL language It can be installed on Mac OS X using FinkFink or even compiled by hand GLPK is a library of functions written in C and is entirely devoted to linear and integer programming In addition it includes a standard LPIP solver glpsol and a modeling language GMPL There is however no graphical interface and all is done using text file and the shell command line A simple session would look like glpsol model model1txt output results1txt where model1txt is an input file containing the required instructions in the GNU MathProg language If the input file is ok glpsol will process

book on Healthrelated quality of life HRQL Quality of Life Impairment in Schizophrenia Mood and Anxiety Disorders edited by MS Ristner and AG Awad Springer 2007 It is not so recent but it is one of the unusually good review on HRQL studies and their applications in clinical settings or clinical trials An older one is Quality of Life and Pharmacoeconomics in Clinical Trials from B Spilker Lippincott Wiliams Wilkins 1995 but its already 1259 pages long FIXME Finish this draft The definition of quality of life as stated by the WHOQOL working group1 is reproduced below Quality of life is an individuals perceptions of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals expectations standards and concerns It is a broad ranging concept affected in a complex way by the persons physical health psychological state level of independence social relationships and their relationship to salient features of their environment We may be tempted to add those questions raised by Elkinton2 some fourty years ago How does the physician protect the proper quality of life of the individual patient How can the quality of life be improved Into which programs of preventive and therapeutic medicine should the resources of society be put to achieve the maximum in health and quality of life for all members of that society An historical account of HRQL research can be found in the review of Medina et al3 From a psychological perspective two questions at least are to be answered by the researcher 1 what factors impact HRQL and 2 what factors impact its subjective reporting Now the NIH has prescribed that all research projects about health disparities or epidemiological studies in general must include minorities to the extent that it seems appropriate to the study under consideration The same applies in clinical trials unless researchers are seeking a very homogeneous group of patients In genetic epidemiology for instance it is common to consider culture a one of the main covariate I quoted the term culture since we more often see words like ethnicity or ancestry in place of culture or even race Following the IOM4 definition race encompasses interindividuals variations at both the biological and behavioral level but see Hernandez and Blazer5 Chapter 5 for an extended discussion on this topic Shields et al6 recommend avoiding the term of race although race and ethnicity appear to bear some explanatory power when predicting disease risk in mental or more common health problems with the exception of the health disparities context in which selfidentified race remains a socially important metric race should be avoided or used with caution and clarification as its meaning encompasses both ancestry and ethnicity Chapter 4 M Bullinger S Schidt and D Naber is entirely devoted to the development of healthrelated instruments across cultures The authors also make a clear distinction between functional impairments as reported in most HRQL instrument and the subjective consequences of these functional limitations Moreover in order to fully capture the concept of quality of life health status measurements should be operationalized both via clinical information and selfreports which is in line with the classical approach to health indicator research p 70 Again I have prepared a quick and

version httpwwwaliquoteorgpubHRQLcrosscultureshtml Visual psychophysics with Python June 2010 I rediscovered the VisionEgg library which is a powerful Python package for building visual and auditory psychophysical experiments among others More generally this can be viewed as a wrapper for Pygame When I started my PhD I was used to the Psychophysics toolboxPsychophysics toolbox for MATLAB but I havent any Mac at that time and it was pretty cool I learned 3 or 4 years ago that most of my visual stimulations could be made thanks to Pygame but this is the end of the story I never had to program any other experiment since then Googling about the Psychtoolbox I learned that it is now compatible with Octave a great news since most of my old Matlab scripts never ran on Octaveoctave but see the aforementioned wiki Setup is quite straightforward although compilation of glqtc failed Most of the demo scripts are running visioneggimg20100619212334png gratingimg20100619212608png A note about PyQt To get a working Qt binding for Python you will need the PyQt4 which also depends on sip Both packages can be downloaded from Note however that they must be compiled as 32 bits since no 64 bits Qt is

Deepayan had a talk about a newly designed graphical interface based on Qt To illustrate the power of this glyphbased device he showed how a scatterplot matrix of 100 random gaussian vectors renders very slowly through lattice compared to QTbased plot Although not ready for production the qtpaint package offers some visualization functionalities that Id like to experiment Obviously the installation doesnt get right out of the box Here is a couple of tricks I used to compile a 64bits version of qtpaint Install Qt not from binary package which is 32bits only but from source wget httpgetqtnokiacomqtsourceqteverywhereopensourcesrc462targz 153 Mb then configure arch x8664 make I think a flag like cocoa might also works and sudo make install the compilation takes about 3 hours on a 28 GHz Core 2 Duo so be patient Download the SVN qtinterfaces bundle package from RforgeRforge eg svn checkout svnsvnrforgerprojectorgsvnrootqtinterfaces CMake 281 grab the source from herehere then bootstrap make and sudo make install upon completion use gcc and g to compile not the llvm suite eg export CXXg export CCgcc Build the R package qtbase using R CMD build qtbase in the svn directory go

across this abstract Weighted index explained more variance in physical function than an additively scored functional comorbidity scale from Resnik L Gozalo P and Hart DL in press in Journal of Clinical Epidemiology Objective 1 examine association between the Functional Comorbidity Index FCI and discharge functional status FS 2 examine impact of FCI on FS when added to comprehensive models and 3 compare additive FCI with weighted FCI and list of condition variables list Study Design and Setting Patients were drawn from Focus On Therapeutic Outcomes Inc FOTO database 1106123107 FS collected using computer adaptive tests Linear regression examined association between FCI and FS Three methods of including functional comorbidities FC were compared Results Relationship between FCI and FS varied by group range 00209 Models with weighted index or list had similar R2 Weighted FCI or list increased R2 of crude models by lt001 for cervical shoulder and lumbar by 001 for wristhand knee and footankle by 002 for hip by 003 for elbow and by 008 for neurological Addition of FCI to comprehensive models added lt001 to R2 all groups Weighted FCI increased R2 by lt001 for cervical lumbar and shoulder by 001 for wristhand hip knee and footankle by 002 for elbow and by 004 for neurological whereas list increased R2 by lt001 for cervical shoulder and lumbar by 001 for knee and footankle by 002 for elbow wristhand and hip and by 005 for neurological Conclusion List of comorbidities or weighted FCI is preferable to using additive FCI Variations around the Lasso October 2010 The Lasso pagehttpwwwstatstanfordedutibslassohtml contains most of what is needed to get started with lasso regression and technical details about L1penalty In what follows I will just review some of the wellknown applications of the Lasso and several casespecific derivations TODO Applications in omics studies1012 Some results support the idea that forward selection performs as well as the Lasso6 and the same authors have proposed the ForwardLasso Adaptive SHrinkage FLASH based on the LARS algorithm It can be shown that the LARS algorithmhttpwwwstatstanfordeduhastiePapersLARSLeastAngle2002pdf yields the entire path of Lasso solutions Quoting the Lasso page the LARS algorithm basically reads 1 Start with all coefficients bj equal to zero 2 Find the predictor xj most correlated with y 3 Increase the coefficient bj in the direction of the sign of its correlation with y Take residuals ry along the way Stop when some other predictor xk has as much correlation with r as xj has 4 Increase bj bk in their joint least squares direction until some other predictor xm has as much correlation with the residual r 5 Continue until all predictors are in the model To get Lasso solutions we just have to modify the above steps as follows if a nonzero coefficient hits zero remove it from the active set of predictors and recompute the joint direction LARS is available in

eHealth and how it applies in real study It appears that very few RCTs are carried out with truly distant intervention programs but electronic coaching especially in psychiatric or psychological followup are increasingly in use at least in the USA What is striking is that numbers clearly show that there are more blacks or hispanics people that are actually using or owning a mobile device than

the many ways to fit a Rasch Model After describing the two most commonly used Likelihoodbased approaches marginal and conditional I shall move onto Bayesian models as implemented in the MCMCpackhttpcranrprojectorgwebpackagesMCMCpackindexhtml and DPpackagehttpcranrprojectorgwebpackagesDPpackageindexhtml Classical approaches marginal and conditional approaches Basically omitting the joint ML approach as in Lord1 or the Winstepshttpwwwwinstepscomindexhtm software we will consider two different ways of estimating parameters of a Rasch Model namely maximizing of the marginal likelihood MML or conditional likelihood CML Actually I drafted a quick and dirty memohttpwwwaliquoteorgcourspsychometricsltmltmpdf some time ago but its in French and is roughly taken from Baker and Kim2 The bery brief idea are summarized in the following paragraphs Following the MML approach as implemented in the ltmhttpcranrprojectorgwebpackagesltmindexhtml package we assume that individual effects are random realizations taken from a population density gp This density is characterized by a vector of parameters from an unknown population and that has to be estimated like the parameters of the fixed effects i The likelihood to be maximized looks like elltextMMLbetapsiprodp1PintinftyinftyPrYpiypimidthetapgthetapmidpsidthetap Depending on the assumptions made on gp three approaches are available namely a nonparametric semiparametric and parametric approach In most parametric settingswe consider an N02 unknown In this case the likelihood can be written as ellbetasigmatheta2prodp1Pellpbetasigmatheta2prodp1PintPrypmidbetathetapphithetapmid 0sigmatheta2dthetap where lp denotes the contribution of person p to the marginal likelihood On the contrary under the CML approach subjectspecific effects disappear from the likelihhod hence the name conditional which now reads elltextCMLbetaprodp1PPrYp1yp1dotsYpIypImid sp and is maximized with repsect to The total score sp is a sufficient statistic for the specific person effect p After conditioning the probability of observing a given response pattern no longer depends on this effect but only on the sufficient statistic The eRmhttpcranrprojectorgwebpackageseRmindexhtml package offers many IRT models that are members of the Rasch family The disadvantage of this method is that it does not allow for any inference on the individuals unless we consider item parameters as known values after their estimation and plug them into the joint likelihood TODO See JSS issue 20 In their JSS paper Extended Rasch Modeling The eRm Package for the Application of IRT Models in Rhttpwwwjstatsoftorgv20i09paper Patrick Mair and coll clearly pointed to the advantages of using CML Mixedeffects logistic model Doug Bates already illustrated the use of his lme4httpcranrprojectorgwebpackageslme4indexhtml package to fit a Rasch Model In fact this is basically the way the marginal approach works Again the problem is merely from a conceptual point of view namely that of treating person parameters as random effects as was discussed in the preceding section Using Poisson regression An example was already provided in Carstensen 2nd book series on Loglinear models chapter xx Estimation with MCMC TODO MCMCirtKd Estimation with Dirichlet The semiparametric Rasch model proposed by San Martin et al3 is shortly described in the online help for DPMrasch Well I must admit I had a hard time to read it as is so that for convenience I put it here with proper LaTeX formatting Even after having that I needed to resort the San Martins article to understand the notation used therein etaijthetaibetaj with the following prior distributions leftbeginarrayrcl thetaimid G sim intmathcalNmusigmaGdmu dsigma

models within a Bayesian framework Usually this is done with the BUGShttpwwwmrcbsucamacukbugs sofwtare Here is an illustration of Rasch modelling with JAGSwwwfisiarcfrmartynsoftwarejags Lets consider the data on verbal aggression described by De Boeck and Wilson in Explanatory Item Response Models Springer 2004 The data set is described pp 710 It consists in Of note the data are now available in the lme4 package Classical IRT approaches There are many ways of estimating parameters from a Rasch model based on this data and we shall concentrate on the marginal and conditional likelihood appraoch The ltm and eRm packages implement these two methods respectively Note that a mixedeffects model will yield comparable results in the former case The Bayesian way Lets now turn our attention to JAGS I already post some notes on Bayesian analysis with R and the following steps are not very different Basically we need to specify our model that is our prior distributions and starting values As there is already a BUGS example included in the online documentation lets look at it first model Rasch model for j in 1N for k in 1T logitpjk betathetaj alphak rjk dbernpjk thetaj dnorm01 Priors

Today I start playing with Hadoophttphadoopapacheorg and Mahouthttpmahoutapacheorg which is a scalable machine learning library that supports large data sets Distributed computing has gained a large interest from the scientific community in these recent years especially because of the ever growing amount of data that one has to proceed from neuorimaging or genetics data to the analysis of social networks or media products Distributed computing Distributed computinghttpenwikipediaorgwikiDistributedcomputing is now widely used for solving complex tasks with huge data set eg data mining forecasting I am particularly interested in its application in largescale studies like the one commonly found in genomewide association or gene screening applications But this is definitively not the purpose of this post Some time ago I read an interesting article about Xgrid on MacResearchhttpwwwmacresearchorg Specifically the author presented a complete example of running a fasta jobhttpwwwmacresearchorgthexgridtutorialspartiiirunningbatchjobs that will scan across all 23 chromosomes According to Apple ACGhttpwwwapplecomacg Xgrid allows almost anyone to easily run a set of calculations on many machines using machinedependent parameters You can keep your focus on the science and mathematics and not distract yourself learning the details of setting up a network of computers You dont have to become a system administrator and set up user accounts and manage the network topology What is Hadoop The Hadoop framework comes with core utilities and a distributed file system management HDFShttphadoopapacheorghdfs which allows to create multiple replicas of data blocks and distributes them on compute nodes throughout a cluster to enable reliable extremely rapid computations The core Hadoop essentially consists in a set of libraries and services for running jobs Assuming you have a dedicated file system to store data IO Hadoop take care of launching and distributing jobs A Single Node Setuphttphadoopapacheorgcommondocscurrentsinglenodesetuphtml is described on Hadoop website I personally put it in usrlocalsharehadoopinstallhadoop0210 and symlinked it to hadoop for short Then I follow the instructions step by step The mapreducehttpenwikipediaorgwikiMapReduce paradigm was introduced by Google some years ago as a framework for distributed computing on large data sets Using a large number of computers or nodes which altogether belong to a cluste the idea is to break a problem into small pieces that are distributed to these nodes that in turn can also address subproblems to their coworkers Upon completion solutions can be sent back to the master node So the basic idea is that of the divide and conquerhttpenwikipediaorgwikiDivideandconqueralgorithm principle The MapReduce documentationhttphadoopapacheorgmapreducedocscurrentindexhtml has some good tutorials to get starting with There are several other projects that are actually hosted under the Apache foundation eg Hivehttphiveapacheorg and Pighttppigapacheorg to name a few As of September 2010 they become toplevel Apache projects I shall discuss them in another post About Mahout Mahout has been released not so recently I guess but I just discovered it The goal of Mahout is to build scalable machine learning libraries Scalable should be understood as a general purpose framework with efficient algorithm and data structures for moderate to large data sets Actually it seems that the four main topics of Mahout are Recommendation mining infer from users choice the best set of item that they might like Clustering identify related documents Classification assign to an unlabelled document its correct category Frequent itemset mining uncover relationships between items based on their frequency of cooccurences Isabel Drost one of the cofounder of Mahout has some online material which I found quite useful to get a first feeling of what Mahout might be good at see eg Apache Mahout Making data analysis easyhttpisabeldrostdehadoopslidesdevoxxpdf Of note shes also actively involved in the NoSQLhttpenwikipediaorgwikiNoSQL paradigm The original work was decribed at NIPS06 in the following paper MapReduce for Machine Learning on Multicorehttpwwwcsstanfordedupeopleangpapersnips06mapreducemulticorepdf Actually several algorithmshttpscwikiapacheorgconfluencedisplayMAHOUTAlgorithms are available including the one I am interested in namely ClusteringhttpscwikiapacheorgconfluencedisplayMAHOUTKMeansClustering at the time of this writing hierarchical clustering doesnt seem to be available yet and Random ForestshttpscwikiapacheorgconfluencedisplayMAHOUTRandomForests Interestingly Mahout also features collaborative filteringhttpenwikipediaorgwikiCollaborativefiltering1 I still have to figure out what the links with preferencebased models in psychometrics if any In R two packages are devoted to frequent itemsets arules and recommenderlab 1 A good review is available in A Survey of Collaborative

Edward G Carmines Sage Publications 1981 This is a concise introduction to the construction of unidimensional scales by means of different historical scaling models namely Thurstone Likert Guttman as well as unfolding theory Basically scaling models may be used to scale persons stimuli or both Likert scaling falls in the first category and as such it is considered a subject or personcentered approach Thurstone dedicated a fair amount of his work on how to measure psychological stimuli and how they can be compared with one another The counterpart of this approach for physical stimuli is the basis for most psychophysics methods The response approach is concerned with scaling subjects and stimuli where the task set for the subject is to respond to a stimulus on the basis of the position of the stimulus in relation to the subjects own position with respect to the attribute This is basically what modern psychometrics intend to do with IRT modeling Thurstone scaling Thurstone is well known for his law of comparative judgmenthttpenwikipediaorgwikiLawofcomparativejudgment whereby each individual makes a discrimination or response involving a judgment as to the relative degree of prestige of each occupation where we assume that the distribution of all discriminal processes aroused by any stimulus will be normal wrt modal discriminal process on the psychological continuum For more information see Thurstone LL 1994 A law of comparative judgmenthttpbitlySMiXCO Psychological Review 1012 266270 According to this law the degree to which any two stimuli can be discriminated is a direct function of the difference in their status as reagrds the attribute in question For instance This has led to developing three distinct methods of scaling paired comparisons successive intervals and equalappearing intervals Here is Edwardss list of desirable characteristics for attitude items 1 Avoid statements that refer to the past rather than to the present 2 Avoid statements that are factual or capable of being interpreted as factual 3 Avoid statements that may be interpreted in more than one way 4 Avoid statements that are irrelevant to the psychological object under consideration 5 Avoid statements that are likely to be endorsed by almost everyone or by almost no one 6 Select statements that are believed to cover the entire range of the affective scale of interest 7 Keep the language of the statements simple clear and direct 8 Each statement should contain only one complete thought 9 Statements containing universals such as all always none and never often introduce ambiguity and should be avoided 10 Words such as only just merely and others of a similar nature should be used with care and moderation in writing statements 11 Whenever possible statements should be in the form of simple sentences rather than in the form of compound or complex sentences Edwards A 1957 Techniques of attitude scale construction Englewood Cliffs NJ

2014 unfilled but not lost forever With slight edits to accomodate a proper archive blog post Stata for structural equation modeling October 2014 As Mplus syntax often appears a bit cryptic to carry out basic operations in Confirmatory Factor Analysis CFA I decided to write out some of the notes I took when using Mplus for recent psychometric studies In what follows I will use data described and analysed in Acocks Stata textbook Discovering Structural Equation Modeling Using StatahttpgooglTJ1W8y Why this book Essentially because it provides a readytouse dataset describe it here and the author discusses several applications of CFA models including tests for measurement invariance without much technical details For those interested in a more rigorous approach I can recommend Structural Equation Modeling Applications Using Mplus by Wang Wang 2012 Wiley FIXME provide URL to 20140702bookreview Multigroup analysis In this post I am interested in assessing weak and strong measurement invariance using Stata and Mplus Both are popular statistical packages and although these are commercial software they are worth their price IMHO Mplus includes more estimators than Stata but probably we could tweak Stata commands to mimic Mplushttpwwwstatacomstatalistarchive201301msg00083html A tutorial on multigroup CFAs with Stata can be found on the UCLA server How can I check measurement invariance using the sem commandhttpwwwatsuclaedustatstatafaqinvariancehtm Basically measurement invariance can be assessed by fitting several nested models where we impose additional constraints at each stage 1 M1 all parameters free 2 M2 metric pattern invariance loadings are invariant 3 M3 strong scalar invariance loadings intercepts are invariant 4 M4 strict invariance loadings intercepts residuals are invariant 5 M5 strict invariance plus factor means are invariant 6 M6 strict invariance plus factor means variances are invariant Configural invariance is usually assessed using M1 the idea being to check that the hypothetized factor structure holds in all groups It is also used as a reference or baseline model against which other models wil be tested Model M2 is the first step to demonstrate weak measurement invariance that is M1 holds ie factor loadings are as expected in all groups but in addition loadings are equal in all subpopulations We only allow item intercepts to differ between subgroups Model M3 is used to test strong measurement invariance where in addition to loadings we impose that item intercepts are equal in all groups A more constrained model M4 also adds the constraint of equal errors of measurement This model and models M5M6 are generally too strong and hard to verify after all we only have one sample and many researchers would be quite happy with demonstrating that strong measurement invariance is verified add reference To get the dataset under Stata we write stata use httpwwwstatapresscomdatadsemusmultgrpcfadta To create a standalone text file we will use the handy Stata progam Stata2mplushttpwwwatsuclaedustatstatafaqstata2mplushtm which allows to convert Stata data file to Mplus input file This is easier than using Stata builtin converters since it will recode missing values remove header and select the correct field delimiter stata stata2mplus using multgrpcfa This generates two files ls multgrpcfa multgrpcfadat

Docker August 2016 Dockerdocker allows to wrap software into a dedicated filesystem available on a server without having to build a complete virtual machine VM with its own operating system OS Docker containers can thus run as isolated processes on any computer and any OS Getting started with Docker There are actually two options to install Docker on a Mac Docker Toolboxdockertoolbox and Docker for Macdockermac The latter does not need to have Virtual Boxvirtualbox installed since it relies on Hyperkithyperkit instead If everything went fine we should be able to query Docker version at the shell prompt docker version Docker version 1120 build 8eab29e Omitting the results in a more verbose output Now with docker run helloworld we can confirm that everything is working as expected Finally to check that the ngynx server is also working we can just type docker run d p 8080 name webserver nginx Unable to find image nginxlatest locally latest Pulling from librarynginx As in the previous case Docker will pull the relevant image from the internet or more precisely the Docker Hubdockerhub This may take some time depending on your internet connection The VMs are installed in LibraryContainerscomdockerdocker It should be noted that this is not reported by docker info We now have a running instance of Docker as shown below docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 706c4d957b24 nginx nginx g daemon off 13 minutes ago Up 13 minutes 00008080tcp 443tcp webserver For whatever reason I couldnt check that ngynx is working on httplocalhost using Emacs eww and I had to launch my browser To stop the running container we just use the following command docker stop 706c4d957b24 where 706c4d957b24 is the contained id that docker ps displayed assuming we didnt set a nameusing the name switchwhen launching the container Well thats pretty all we need to know to start from scratch with Docker Spacemacs March 2016 As discussed in many posts of mine I am a big fond of GNU Emacs I use it all the time in my daily work Last year I was just saying that I will stay with my Homebrewed Emacsemacs and my own configuration I finally resign like I did before when I decided to switch to Homebrew instead of compiling everything from scratch on my Mac The main reasons are I no longer need to keep an eye on what best packages do exist for specific tasks since Spacemacs Prelude or other Emacs distribution will likely include them in their core packages I also dont need to worry about updating my whole emacsd since those same distributions usually allow to update everything quite easily In the mean time I found interesting blog posts like Spacemacs for 2016milosophical or Org mode and Pandocrousette where authors describe their experience with Spacemacs Everything seems to work right out of the box A quick check allowed me to confirm that Slime and CIDER can be directly fired from a Lisp or Clojure buffer while IPython is the default REPL that is launched when visiting a Python file Spacemacs relies on anaconda modeanacondamode not to be confused with Anaconda Pythonanaconda which was a little bit tricky to configure I ran into trouble with Homebrew Python and then once I installed Anaconda Python with pip itself1 but see this discussionissue2917 Most important to me is the ability to use ESSess to manage my statistical projects and it also proved to work quite smoothly Spacemacs in 2016img20160505123817png Some key features are highlighted below Emacs editing mode Of course I stay on holy mode because I know nothing about Vim and I dont want to learn a new set of key habits especially modal interaction with my text editor So I know that I can find everything with Mx as before but that I now benefit from Mm and Escm and much more thanks to Helmhelm and which keywhichkey but see my next point Helm and which key I think Spacemacs is just an incredible idea for Emacs users at least because it offers a great UI while maintaining availbale key bindings You dont need to learn anything except that you just want to forget about your emacs or initel config file and replace it with spacemacs or something elseemacsd if you like Now you get additional pleasure Mm socalled leader keyleader will trigger a dedicated Helm minibuffer Spacemacs and whichkeyimg20160505122628png Beside Helm completion minibuffer Spacemacs also provide socalled micro states which allows to perform quick repetitive action eg dealing with buffers by simple key presses Documentation The documentation is well just great Everything comes as Orgorgformatted files and it is readily available via Mm h SPC or we can just press the F1 key to get a series of helprelated commands Layers I really like the concept of layers packages are loaded on demand and can be updated very easily Gorgeous themes just add themesmegapack to your configuration layer and you get some 100 dark or light themes for Emacs but see this online gallerythemes for an overview I personally use the atomonedarkthemeonedark with Source Code Prosourcecode 13pt and this can be added to the additional packages layer Syntax checking and spell checking They are available via simple Toggle Mm t s or S Workspace and layouts A combination of latest Spacemacs perspbased layout and eyebrowse Update packages and Spacemacs 1 And then with Python 35 which was installed as the default Python interpreter by conda because I use offlineimapofflineimap to fetch my email on my local HD and process them with mu4emu4e and it is not compatible with Python 35 sigh Maybe I should

overviewhttpbioinformaticsoxfordjournalsorgcontent165412abstract Bioinformatics 2000 165 412424 Here is the abstract We provide a unified overview of methods that currently are widely used to assess the accuracy of prediction algorithms from raw percentages quadratic error measures and other distances and correlation coefficients and to information theoretic measures such as relative entropy and mutual information We briefly discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach For classification tasks we derive new learning algorithms for the design of prediction systems by directly optimising the correlation coefficient We observe and prove several results relating sensitivity and specificity of optimal systems While the principles are general we illustrate the applicability on specific problems such as protein secondary structure and signal peptide prediction Lets start by considering a twoway table looking like the one shown below MM DTPFN DFPTN where M and D are predicted and true class membership means positivenegative instances in both cases The corresponding cells sum to 1 and read as TP resp TN for true positive resp negative the number of times a positive respnegative instance is correctly classified FP resp FN for false positive resp negative the number of time a positive respnegative instance is incorrectly classified The task is to derive a suitable way to summarize performance accuracy of a given classification algorithm based on these four numbers which amounts to define a certain distance between M and D Percentagebased measures The percentages of correct positive PCP and negative PCN predictions are known as the sensitivity and specificity they are given by textPCPfractextTPtextTPtextFNquad textPCNfractextTNtextTNtextFP Of note we have PCP Prinstance classified as positive instance is truly positive whereas in a statistical decision framework the Type I error risk is Prinstance classified as positive instance is truly negative The following Table summarizes the correspondence between decision theory and classification results imgCwhnspng As shown below a correct rejection of H0 occurs with probability 1 and may be considered as test specificity imgKRJ3Bpng Distancebased measures Any Lp distance between M and D defined as Lpleftsumi dimip right1p can be used but usually these are the L1 Hamming L2 Euclidean or L sup In the binary case the Lp distance reduces to FNFP1p For the Hamming distance it is worth noting that it is simply FPFN so that it is equivalent to a percentage measure However as it does not account for possible imbalance between positive vs negative instances it becomes poorly useful when this ratio moves away from 5050 Also in the binary case the euclidean distance reduces to the Hamming distance Correlationbased measures Lets recall the classical Pearsons correlation coefficient Csumifracdibar dmibar msigmaDsigmaM I learned that for binary variables it is also known as

econometricshttpwwweconomicsharvardedufacultystockfilesisb201049pdf Most importantly this genetic variant is unrelated to the confounding factors but it is predictive of the exposure factor The effect of the genetic variant is not direct and conditional on exposure and confounders the genetic variant is independent of the outcome Testing the association between this genetic variant and the outcome

on The Estimation of Item Response Models with the lmer Function from the lme4 Package in Rhttpwwwjstatsoftorgv39i12 by De Boeck and coll As the title suggests this article is about fitting IRT models with a mixedeffects model approach This is an interesting article because Ive been working on that some four years ago now The code I produced at that time was based on the De Boecks book Paul De Boeck Mark Wilson Explanatory Item Response Models A Generalized Linear and Nonlinear Approach Springer 2004 but due to lack of time was never pursued to its end maybe like most of tutorials I wrote actually Also I started writing a short note on fitting Rasch models in R using classical CML or MMLbased approaches JAGS Poisson model etc I will link to it at a later time Back to De Boecks article It all starts with the idea of applying an GLMM to the matrix of items responses with additional indicators for item or subjectspecific cofactors Using an GLMM has already been described by Doug Bates in an older issue Doran H Bates D Bliese P and Downling M 2007 Estimating the Multilevel Rasch Model With the lme4 Packagehttpwwwjstatsoftorgv20i02paper JSS 202 and also in some of his talk at UseR or elsewhere see eg the slides sectionhttplme4rforgerprojectorgslides on RForge The Rasch model RM takes the form etapithetapXi0sumi1KbetaiXik where i and p are indexes for items and persons and X is the design matrix where Xik 1 if i k i1 dots K and Xi0 1 for all items The distribution of ability is gaussian with SD theta In a simplified form we find the wellknown formulation of the RM as denoting an interactive effect of subjects ability and item difficulty on the logit scale etapithetapbetai Of course we can use a different link function such as the probit if we want the socalled normal ogive model A general formula interface for such a model under lme4 reads r lmerresp 1 it 1id familybinomiallogit where everything that follows the operator stands for the linear component described in the first equation above More interestingly De Boecks et al then give detailed explanations on how to fit more customized IRT models Here is a short memo of common R notation for the main models used in psychometric research Item covariates ie the linear logistic test model LLTM with ot without an added error term which allows for imperfect predictions and seems more realistic in many situations The general R syntax for this kind of model is 1 i1 i2 1 id and the error term is added as 1 item which means that we assume an homoscedastic effect Item partitioning that is considering a multidimensional model instead of a single latent trait as in the RM This means modifying the design matrix X so that it becomes a P x I x K matrix in long format with K I Kstar where Kstar is the number of binary item partition covariates Of note partition can correspond to a nesting or crossing structure More importantly a multidimensional model for a crossed item design is not identified unless restrictions are imposed on the model For example the model is again identified if the correlations between the dimensions referring to different partitions are fixed to zero p 13 A model with two groups of items would read 1 item 1 i1 i2 id Person covariates as commonly found in the latent rxegression Rasch model can be fitted easily assuming two kind of covariance structure homo or heteroscedastic The general syntax is 1 item p1 1 id or 1 item p1 1 p1 id under the heteroscedasticity asumption Person partitioning also known as multilevel models when talking about nested structure The syntax is rather simple 1 item 1 id 1 group Personbyitem covariates which mainly concern differential effect functioning local dependency models and dynamic model The latter is useful for modeling learning effect for example In all three cases we need to build an extended design matrix In conclusion this article might be very useful for extending the class of IRT models available under R With

response model known as the monotone homogeneity model Mokken scale analysis can be seen as a hierarchical scaling method where we make the assumption that there exist an underlying latent trait that explain covariation between item responses As in other IRT models items are thought to be orderable by difficulty such that any individual who endorses a particular item should endorse one with a lower difficulty as in Guttman scalinghttpenwikipediaorgwikiGuttmanscale but perfectly ordered response patterns are rarely met in practice especially in some fields of research Individual scores are then computed as the rank of the highest endorsed item in this hierarchy ie it is a simple total score sum of positive responses Unlike Guttman scaling however Mokken scaling relies on a probabilistic framework1 The reproducibility of response patterns are typically assessed using a coefficient of reproducibility a coefficient of scalability andor Loevingers coefficient of homogeneity1 More discussion can be found in eg Sijtsma and Verweij2 or Mokkan and Lewis3 The use of Mokken scale analysis is largely found in patient outcome research ranging from psychiatric or clinical research46 to

generally of ensemble methods is rather simple Ensemble learning refers to the procedures employed to train multiple learning machines and combine their outputs treating them as a committee of decision makers The principle is that the decision of the committee with individual predictions combined appropriately should have better overall accuracy on average than any individual committee member At a more abstract level The study of ensemble methods with model outputs considered for their abstract properties rather than the specifics of the algorithm which produced them allows for a wide impact across many fields of study If we can understand precisely why when and how particular ensemble methods can be applied successfully we would have made progress toward a powerful new tool for Machine Learning the ability to automatically exploit the strengths and weaknesses of different learning systems Several algorithms are then described including Adaboost bagging boosting mixture of experts before discussing some more theoretical perspectives namely ensemble diversity where the central idea is quoted below The optimal diversity is fundamentally a credit assign ment problem If the committee as a whole makes an erroneous prediction how much of this error should be attributed to each member More precisely how much of the committee prediction is due to the accuracies of the individual models and how much is due to their interactions when they were combined We would ide ally like to reexpress the ensemble error as two distinct components a term for the accuracies of the

Gistgist it could certainly be optimized here and there but I wrote this R script very quickly to illustrate those ideas Here are the distributions I got when considering a predefined difference of delta003 top and 006 bottom between groupspecific parameters regression coefficients among endogeneous variables called BE in simsemmodel for a fixed sample size of n200 these values can be changed at the top of the R script And here are the same results in the case of N 300 The above simulations just confirm that with a larger sample size we are more likely to demonstrate significant difference in multigroup comparison especially when effect size increases However the main point is that it is quite easy to implement permutation or bootstrapbased procedures to compare combination of parameter estimates between several groups The same resampling strategy could of course be applied to estimate number of subjects needed to reach a certain statistical power but in fact the simsemsimsem package does that particularly well 1 In this case it may be more interesting to take the square of the regression coefficients before combining them using the geometric mean blog

notes with new material This is motivated by my new interest toward bioinformatics and medical imaging that are both facing the n p and pvalue correction problems Multiple comparisons arise when one wants to compare more than two things at the same time ie for the same dataset in the same explanatory framework Why do we have to adapt the usual test statistics Because these multiple tests of hypothesis are generally not carried out in an independent way thus leading to an inflation of the overall type I error rate In other words when faced with say 10 comparisons on the same data the probability of falsely detecting a significant difference becomes greater than the classical 5 level For a general introduction to multiple comparison procedure the reader may be interested in sup6sup Other references are 57 and 8 especially Chapter 5 but the latter two are a bit more tricky Actually there are two main packages that can handle multiple comparison both relying on a different view of

pvalues confidence regions and test statistic cutoffs The procedures are directly applicable to identifying differentially expressed genes in DNA microarray experiments Interestingly the former is attached to the Social Sciences Task View while the latter is on BioconductorBioconductor Also I should mention the Design see its contrast function package by F HarrellF Harrell the npmc package for non parametric multiple comparisons but see R Site SearchR Site Search with keyword multiple comparison For the purpose of the illustration we will use the data from the Cholesterol study included in the multcomp package A clinical study was conducted to assess the effect of three formulations of the same drug on reducing cholesterol The formulations were 20mg at once 1time 10mg twice a day 2times and 5mg four times a day 5times In addition two competing drugs were used as control group drugD and drugE The purpose of the study was to find which of the formulations if any is efficacious and how these formulations compare with the existing drugs Using multcomp The main function is called glht and its description indicates that it provides general linear hypotheses and multiple comparisons for parametric models including generalized linear models linear mixed effects models and survival models Well it covers quite interesting models for a biostatistician First lets try a basic ANOVA model

the data shown in the figure below img20080726232906png However what can be said about the paired difference between consecutive formulations 20mg at once 10mg twice a day 5mg four times a day and how

convenient way see plotglht The main interface to glht is the option linfct which stands for linear function in the GLM framework Any contrast can be passed directly as a vector or matrix to glht or one can choose among those already constructed with the contrMat function Available contrasts coding are Dunnett Tukey Sequen AVE Changepoint Williams Marcus McDermott UmbrellaWilliams GrandMean They all are referenced from Bretz et al4 As for R default contrast coding scheme ie treatment contrast the default contrasts are Dunnett contrast that is all k1 comparisons are done with reference to the

similar contrast matrix by calling contrtreatment4 Note that such contrasts are not orthogonal to the Intercept and thus are not pure contrasts in standard LM Theory Also note that some software doesnt take the first level as the baseline but instead choose the last one It is the case for SAS at least If were interested in getting the same result as SAS we can either relevel the factor specify which level to consider as the baseline option base in contrtreatment or simply use the wrapper function contrSAS The table below summarizes the different contrasts coding scheme in the

different approach to the correction for Type I error rate inflation As explained in Dudoit S and van der Laansup7sup Section 28 we only consider the control of Type I error under the true parameter values or the true generating distribution in the case of simulated data Furthermore this is not a strong control over the error rate ER as the proposed methodology doesnt control the supremum of the Type I ER over parameter values satisfying all 2supMsup possible subsets of null hypotheses The functions mtrawp2adjp and mtplot are by far the most useful routines for computing and displaying

Childs B Vidal M and Barabasi AL 2007 The human disease networkhttpwwwpnasorgcontent104218685fullpdfhtml Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 10421 86858690 A network of disorders and disease genes linked by known disordergene associations offers a platform to explore in a single graphtheoretic framework all known phenotype and disease gene associations indicating the common genetic origin of many diseases Genes associated with similar disorders show both higher likelihood of physical interactions between their products and higher expression profiling similarity for their transcripts supporting the existence of distinct diseasespecific functional modules We find that essential human genes are likely to encode hub proteins and are expressed widely in most tissues This suggests that disease genes also would play a central role in the human interactome In contrast we find that the vast majority of disease genes are nonessential and show no tendency to encode hub proteins and their expression pattern indicates that they are localized in the functional periphery of the network A selectionbased model explains the observed difference between essential and disease genes and also suggests that diseases caused by somatic mutations should not be peripheral a prediction we confirm for cancer genes Another example of spatial representation of a connected network is the now wellknown NexusNexus application that can access any FacebookFacebook account More generally social networks rely on similar facilities for geometric visualization of relationships The

ECM 2012 conferencehttpwwwecm2012com that was held in Santiago de Compostela As was the case for to the preceding one and in contrast to the annual conference from the Psychometric Society this conference is generally more heavily oriented toward psychological applications and less place is devoted to psychometric hard methods except for Fridays morning sessions There was a workshop on applied IRT modeling with R but I completely missed it Niels Smits talked about the use of ordinal regression in place of traditional IRT models in computerized adaptive testing from the perspective of automatic classification The general idea was to generalize the techniques proposed to handle binary decision eg at risk vs not at risk to multiple categories This in turn calls for finding method to obtain scale score probabilities with Likerttype items Usually the proportional odds model works quite well in this situation and it is less demanding in terms of assumptions unidimensionality indicator variables etc Basically a simple way to understand the approach is to reverse the standard view point instead of working with PrYle j we work with PrYjmid xxi where xi stands for the location of a given individual on the latent trait An illustration with real data collected on the CESD scale 20 03 items was also given It should be noted that the author also use this instrument to develop a computerized adaptive version see references at the end Jos Muiz provided two nice presentations on computerized adaptive testing for the assessment of schizotypy and the estimation of reliability in personality tests with missing values What was interesting during the first talk is the fact that assessing such clinical sample invariably lead to assymmetrical distribution in response scores In other words almost everybody is going well and this is a big challenge for psychometric models I do not know if much research has been done in this filed but I suspect this would be good to write something about best practices to handle such extreme cases More generally this study relies on the psychometric highrisk paradigm see eg Psychometric highrisk paradigm perceptual aberrations and schizotypy an updatehttp1usagovNEWHIa and considers there is a psychosis continuum whereby an individual might evolve from personality traits disorder to psychosis The authors use the CAT algorithm from Walker 2010 considering an estimation error 032 In this particular study however CAT didnt prove very convincing with respect to the number of items retained in final version 40 reduction with binary items1 less than 40 reduction with Likerttype items Relying on a shadowtests strategyhttpbitlyQn1Qrx may be an alternative to the simple CAT algorithm A good overview of CAT is available in one of the PARE publications A Framework for the Development of Computerized Adaptive TestshttpbitlyNEXngr2 The second talk was oriented toward practitioners hence the focus on SPSS imputation methods The idea is that most of the times biostatisticians do not focus on the quality of the instruments on which data are collected However there are almost always some missing data that we can just ignore or replace with invented ones So the idea is to study the influence of missingness on estimated psychometric parameters like reliability validity differential item functioning or item functions This work was concerned with the effect of missing values on reliability measures For large sample about 3000 individuals SPSS imputation based on ML covariance matrix appears to give the best results A key paper on missing data is Schafer JL Graham JW Missing data Our view of the state of the art Psychological Methods 2002 72144177 See also Waymans paper on multiple imputation

note","tags":["emacs","apple"],"href":"/notes-taking-workflow","content":"Over the years I have been using various approaches to note taking on my Mac especially to annotate articles or books I read or just quickly write some reminders or archive snippets of code None has definitely been satisfactorythe last iteration was a combination of a standard BibTeX file and hundreds of ebooks managed by Papershttpswwwreadcubecompapers app and I definitely need a more robust workflow So I decided to start again from scratch Since I use Spacemacs1 for almost everything serious in my work I set up a solution entirely based on two dedicated directories and a set of Markdown and Org files I took inspiration from a very instructive Reddit threadhttpswwwredditcomremacscomments4gudywhelpmewithmyorgmodeworkflowfornotetaking in which one of the poster describes his setup to manage bibliographic entries using a combination of Helmbibtexhttpsgithubcomtmalsburghelmbibtex and orgrefhttpsgithubcomjkitchinorgref and by another great blog post by Piotr Limanowski Reading for Programmershttpscodearsonistcomreadingforprogrammers I followed the instructions to initialise Helmbibtex and orgref which basically amounts to define a few variables in my emacs as described on the Github links referenced above For whatever reason we have to define the PDF directory and the BibTeX file twice but this is something that I can live with However at some point I should really setq a constant filename to define the BibTeX file since I only have once now Previously I was exporting a separate bib file from Papers app to help differentiate entries coming from Papers and Emacs The BibTeX keys are automagically generated Cc Cc when editing an entry and formatted thanks to additional work from orgrefcleanbibtexentry Sometimes the bibtex mode does not do a good job at generating a proper key and I found that the combination of the two commands yields best results Each key basically consists in the name of the first author the year and the abbreviated titleall separated with hyphen to avoid messing the PDF filename with colon all over Using this scheme cormen2009introdalgor will stand for the following entry Cormen Thomas H and Leiserson Charles E and Rivest Ronald L and Stein Clifford Introduction to Algorithms 2009 The MIT Press Then Helmbibtex comes to the rescue and it really is a killer package It can be insinuated in TeX Org Markdown and Text mode and it is bound to Mm m i c major mode insert orgref in Markdown or you can just Mx helmbibtex just about anywhere For instance in a Markdown file like the one I am currently editing it will bring up a window where I can locate or search all my references like in Deft modehttpsjblevinsorgprojectsdeft and insert a reference that pandocciteprochttpsgithubcomjgmpandocciteproc will take care of formatting in the final bibliography for me Moreover I can annotate or update any entry on the fly and of course if there is an associated PDF file I can read it right away I do not use Interleave that much nor orgnoterhttpsgithubcomweirdNoxorgnoter In fact I am fine with reading articles or books using Preview Skim or Highlightshttphighlightsappnet app which offers a nice UI for visualizing annotations and highlighted paragraphs But i know that I could potentially use Emacs as a PDF reader thanks to the pdftoolshttpsgithubcompolitzapdftools package Likewise I still use the great Markedhttpmarked2appcom app to visualize the final output of my Markdown files even if Emacs already has a live preview modehttpsjblevinsorgprojectsmarkdownmode Finally I added a few templates for orgcapturehttpsorgmodeorgmanualCapturehtml which are heavily inspired from the documentation itself and a few links I found on the internet nothing really original TODO item and Journal entry But I also have a quick template for capturing web link I am

discovered that there is an Emacs major mode for managing Hugo blogs namely emacseasyhugohttpsgithubcommasasamemacseasyhugo available on MELPA It allows to write in Markdown or with orgmode directly

from scratch like I did during the past 10 years The fact that I would have to reinstall a bunch of software and libraries on a new MacBook has long prevented me from upgrading last year However it only took 34 hours to get a working workstation the day I got this MacBook thanks to Homebrew Everything is installed under usrlocalCellar and binaries are symlinked to usrlocalbin So this does not really make a big difference compared to the way I used to maintain my Mac year after year except that for now I no longer have to fix myself broken dependencies and tweak Makefile or configure

gained in stability and performance Since I was able to configure everything very quickly as a result of relying on Homebrew not Apple per se without sacrificing to much of my preceding workflows for

lookandfeel of the desktop including the relooked Dock and the window management systemthough I still use Moomhttpmanytrickscommoom to resize windows One of my Email addons CargoLifterhttpwwwchungwasoftcomcargolifter was broken after the update but Apple now provides a way to attach via iCloud large documents to email so this is not a big deal I had to install a Java6compatible package from Apple website and Oracle JDK 8 since some of my software eg Mathematica didnt play well with the new Java version that ships with Yosemite I followed some Homebrewrelated advices that I found on Google and updating my system took something like two hours But after the update everything was fine and no program was broken I updated part of my workflow I now pick up R from Homebrew because I finf it more convenient to update everything with brew However I had to reinstall all packages that include compiled C or Fortran code I no longer have R GUI but I never really used it I have Emacs ESS and RStudio for coding in R One minor issue was to symlink optX11 to usrX11 to resolve some problem with fontconfig or tcltk not sure for the later though For Julia rather than recompiling each time from my local GitHub repository I decided to fetch a Homebrew version thanks to Zachary M Joness nice post on Setting up OSX for Data Analysishttpzmjonescommacsetup brew tap

Equating Tests by Experts Judgment According to Thurstones paired comparisons model1 but see also WikipediaWikipedia pairs of object are compared with respect to a single attribute which is conceived as being represented in the judges mind as a psychological latent trait Following Bramleys notation this is modeled as ln leftfracPij1Pijright Bi Bj where Bi and Bj correspond to measures recorded for item i and j respectively Pij can be conceived as the probability that item i beats ie is being ranked above than item j for any observer its just an odds In contrast with the Partial Credit Model PCM the model fitted is lnleftPirk1Pirk1right Bi Drk Now the model becomes an adjacentcategory model where Bi is the measure for item i and Drk is the difficulty of scale category k relative to category k1 in ranking r The BradleyTerry Model for paired preferences If we consider a square table whose K entries refer to the number of times category a is preferred to category b after emptying the main diagonal the BT Model can be expressed as logfracPiabPiba betaa betab where Piab fracexpbetaaexpbetaaexpbetab is the probability that a is preferred to b It can be shown that the number nab people who prefer a compared to b follows a binomial distribution whose parameter is the above estimated probability The R package BradleyTerry includes the necessary code to carry out the test of such model D

regression","tags":["statistics"],"href":"/penalized-likelihood-regression","content":"Recently I was reading some posts on Google groups and I found an interesting issue on stepwise selection for logistic regression which was raised on MedstatshttpgroupsgooglecomgroupMedStats Frank Harrell provides extensive coverage of model selection in his most famous book Regression Modeling Strategies Springer 2001 He also wrote several articles on this topic and several of them can be found online eg Regression Modeling and Validation Strategieshttpciteseeristpsueduharrell97regressionhtml see also 5 The following article highlights the use of Penalized Maximum Likelihood Estimation to predict binary outcomes Moons KG Donders AR Steyerberg EW Harrell FE J Clin Epidemiol 2004 5712 126270 The abstract can be found on Medline and is reproduced below BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE There is growing interest in developing prediction models The accuracy of such models when applied in new patient samples is commonly lower than estimated from the development sample This may be because of differences between the samples andor because the developed model was overfitted too optimistic Various methods including bootstrapping techniques exist for afterwards shrinking the regression coefficients and the models discrimination and calibration for overoptimism Penalized maximum likelihood estimation PMLE is a more rigorous method because adjustment for overfitting is directly built into the model development instead of relying on shrinkage afterwards PMLE has been described mainly in the statistical literature and is rarely applied to empirical data Using empirical data we illustrate the use of PMLE to develop a prediction model METHODS The accuracy of the final PMLE model will be contrasted with the final models derived by ordinary stepwise logistic regression without and with shrinkage afterwards The potential advantages and disadvantages of PMLE over the other two strategies are discussed RESULTS PMLE leads to smaller prediction errors provides for model reduction to a userdefined degree and may differently shrink each predictor for overoptimism without sacrificing much discriminative accuracy of the model CONCLUSION PMLE is an easily applicable and promising method to directly adjust clinical prediction models for overoptimism So what is PMLE exactly First of all lets talk about standard MLE The reader may recall that an ML estimate is the value that maximizes the likelihhod function given the sample of observations In the case of linear or binomial regression any OLS estimate intercept or slope coincides with the ML estimate For the latter case this results from the fact that estimating the proportion of binary outcome coded as 01 is equivalent to computing its arithmetic mean Usually ML estimates are found by maximizing the loglikelihood or minimizing the likelihood but working with the loglikelihood is often computationally easier We first compute the partial derivatives of the likelihood function with respect to each of the parameter of interest and find those values that zero these expressions checking the sign of the second derivatives ensures that this is a a global optimum and not a local one On the contrary OLS estimates are found by solving a system of linear relations subject to minimizing the mean square error It is more an algebric technique that can be applied to any linear combination of predictors with identically distributed errors However more robust methods are available such as quantile regression resistant regression MMestimator2 etc OLS and ML procedures are well documented in most classical textbook so I will not go further onto these topics Penalized MLE is another way to find the estimates of regression coefficients for the case of categorical predictors without fitting noise in the data Harrell p 207 It shall not be confused with Weighted MLE whereby each observation or case and not the predictors is weighted depending on some available characteristics Other widely used approaches are shrinkage technique such as ridge regression eg 67 Following Harrell one wish to maximize the PMLE given by log L frac12lambdasumi1psibetai2 where L denotes the usual likelihood function and lambda is a penalty factor The scale factors s1 s2dots si can be viewed as the shrinkage related factors per se Indeed one can assign scale constant of zero for parameters for which no shrinkage is desired Scaling by standard deviation is a good choice when predictor are continuous and enter linearly in the model Otherwise and in particular with dummy coding of predictor in this case SD is simply sqrtd1d where d is the mean of the binary variable it might lead to severe distorsion of the shrinkage correction Scale factors are not needed if we work with standardized data but we loose the possibility of interpreting the betas on the link scale Maximization of the above equation is usually done via NewtonRaphson algorithm1 Other details are covered in Harrell pp 208209 in particular how to compute the corresponding degrees of freedom as well as the variancecovariance matrix and a modified AIC The following is a short snippet from Harrell pp 209210 illustrating PLME analysis with simulated data in R r libraryDesign setseed191 x1 rnorm100 y x1 rnorm100 pens df aic c00752616

deviance is 13343 899 df Of course you will probably obtain different results since it depends on the state of your random generator If we were to select a more parcimonious variable subset we might use r stepplrxy The output indicates that X1 X4 and X9cdot X1 have to be included in the final model Residual deviance now becomes 11957 on 96 df Why stepwise model selection isnt a good idea There are basically three widely used techniques for model selection forward selection backward elimination and stepwise selection The later can be described in terms of the two other approaches in particular for the stopping rules Uses both the forward selection and backward elimination criteria Variable selection process terminates when all variables in the model meet the criterion to stay and no variables outside the model meet the criteria to enter Criterion for a variable to enter need not be the same as the criterion for the variable to stay Some advantage in using a more relaxed criterion for entry to force the selection process to consider a larger number of subsets of variables Leaps and bounds is another algorithm that was proposed by 9 It allows to find the optimal subset of predictor variables without actually examining all the potential subsets Its application is limited however to subsets of no more than 30 to 50 variables So why not to use stepwise selection Frank Harrell Chapter 4 pp 5660 provides some clues to the problem of model selection This hot topic is also discussed in several books on regression analysis including 3 and 4 for example When using a stepwise procedure for variable selection one must bear in mind that 1 It yields R2 values that are biased toward higher values 2 The ordinary F and 2 statistics dont follow their assumed distribution 3 Standard errors of regression coefficient estimates are biased low and CI for effects and predicted values are falsely narrow 4 Regression coefficients are biased toward higher values calling for shrinkage correction 5 It yields too liberal Pvalues due to neglected multiple comparison problems 6 It does not solve the problem of collinearity correlation between some of the predictors See also these postshttpwwwpitteduwpilibstatfaqregrfaqhtml compiled by R Ulrich and 8 Some authors regard this approach as reveling dredginghttpenwikipediaorgwikiDatadredging In short stepwise selection as well as backward and forward procedures are automated techniques that have to be avoided if one really wants to explore a large set of variables in order to build a confirmatory model Quoting Harrell p 58 If stepwise selection must be used a global test of no regression should be made before proceeding simultaneously testing all candidate predictors and having degrees of freedom equal to the number of candidate variables plus any nonlinear or interaction terms If this global test is not significant selection of individually significant predictors is usually not warranted However when a serious background suggests that some of the variables should be present in the model stepwise selection could be of interest though it doesnt provide a conservative way to assess the contribution of a given variable to the model We are generally looking for a parcimonious model including primary variables of interest and some other influential factors In epidemiology for example sex age or tobacco consumption are mandatory variables when modeling some forms of cancer It would be unbelievable not to include them in a model With this respect backward and forward procedures arent very recommended when there are plenty of variables since they dont offer the choice to specify a subset of variables of interest which have to be conserved during the whole selection process As proposed by 10 Least Angle Regression11 and the Lasso7 techniques offer better alternatives to classical automated selection procedures Instead of stepwise variable selection algorithm using methods such as fullmodel fits or datareduction ensure a better approach to largescale model assessment In particular the selection of less complex models that are more in agreement with subject matter knowledge should be favored The Lasso technique is a penalized estimation technique in which the estimated regression coefficients are constrained so that the sum of their scaled absolute values falls below some constant k chosen by crossvalidation Although computationally demanding this technique offers a way to constrain some regression coefficient to be exactly zero while shrinking the remaining coefficients toward zero There are several examples of its use in 6 as well as in the R software see the ElemStatLearn package References 1 Ridolfi A and Idier J 2002 Penalized Maximum Likelihood

ready to examine the autoradiographs Two years had elapsed since I first envisioned this experiment and now the results were in I had the six numbers I needed Ive lost the labels my technician said as she handed me the results This was a dire situation Without the labels I had no way of knowing which cell cultures had been treated with vitamin E and which had not Then follows the general strategy of testing or decision making about statistical hypothesis 1 Analyze the problemidentify the hypothesis the alternative hypotheses of interest and the potential risks associated with a decision 2 Choose a test statistic 3 Compute the test statistic 4 Determine the frequency distribution of the test statistic under the hypothesis 5 Make a decision using this distribution as a guide It is interesting that this general strategy not only applies to permutation testing but to bootstrap or parametric testing as well Also I like the fact that point 4 does not restrain the sampling distribution to be known under the null hypothesis even if it is implicitly stated that the hypothesis under consideration is a null one But as I pointed in another post you may want to consider an alternative H0 which do not reflect the null effect The first part is mainly a summary of what is found on the Wikipedia section on ResamplingResampling Resampling techniques include the bootstrap jacknife crossvalidation and permutation procedures but they are not all equivalent with respect to their aims or computational requirements Bootstrap and jacknife techniques are mostly used for parameter estimation sampling distribution under the null bias and standard error of the test statistic robust confidence intervals Both methods estimate the variability of a statistic from the variability of that statistic between subsamples rather than from parametric assumptions Jacknifing might be easier to implement with complex design but bootstrap is now common practice in various field For instance I use it when I want to associate confidence intervals to Cronbachs alpha intraclass correlation Spearman correlation or regression coefficients for smallsample studies Crossvalidation is a general technique for estimating the predictive quality of a statistical model Subsets of the data are held out for use as validating sets a model is fit to the remaining data a training set and used to predict for the validation set Averaging the quality of the predictions across the validation sets yields an overall measure of prediction accuracy Various methods can be implemented for crossvalidating a given model Most of the time these are fold validaiton or leaveoneout scheme which is just the extreme case of kfold with k1 and is equivalent to jacknife Finally permutation or rerandomization tests are used for hypothesis testing where the reference distribution is obtained by calculating all possible values of the test statistic or a subset thereof under rearrangements of the labels on the observed data points In the former case the test is said to be an exact test When we only derive the empirical distribution for a fixed number of samples say 1000 to get an expected alpha level of 5 this boils down to an approximate test The following picture summarizes the aforementioned procedures A simple bootstrap can be carried out in R with few lines of

backupmytweetshttpbackupmytweetscom to get an archive of my Twitter account chlalannehttpstwittercomchlalanne Everything went fine and my tweets were available after a few days What is annoying however is that I cannot download the data I tried several times during the last two weeks and I always end up with the following message bmtimg20110113183758png So I decided to save the raw HTML page and then process it manually This was done using a Perl script1 tweetshtml2txtplhttpwwwaliquoteorgpubtweetshtml2txtpl Basically it does the following read in the HTML file extract the content included between tags and output the date and text of each tweet I can then process these data with R although I could have manage to do this with perl too Here is a sample of the raw text file tweetstxt that I am currently working on 20090712 In Copenhagen for the DSC2009 conference 20090708 Is attending the UseR 2009 conference in Rennes 20090325 Attending the 3rd Workshop on Genomic Epidemiology I was initially thinking of processing these data with R But now that I have a clean text file I can use unx commandline utilities to get some rough measures of my Twitter activity cat tweetstxt grep Retweet wc l cat tweetstxt grep o E AZaz09 uniq c sort r head n 5 cat tweetstxt grep o E colornever 094092092 uniq c sort k 2 The first command gives me the number of retweets and the second list the frequency of the top five hash tags The last command filter the number of tweets by date in chronological order The last one can be directly piped to the graph utility from the plotutilshttpwwwgnuorgsoftwareplotutils package However the data looks like 1 20090325 1 20090621 2 20090708 and we need to have data formatted as xy pairs arranged by columns this means that I need either to add line numbers to the result and ignore the third column of date or to swap the columns returned by the third command in both cases I also need to remove color otherwise shell escape formatting characters will be printed int he results file The first solution is roughly obtained with eg nl cut c 111 tweetsbydatedat graph T ps F HersheySans f 0035 S 2 0025 m 0 X Time Y Frequency plotps graph1img20110117130656png Yep we are far from a ggplot2httphadconzggplot2 picture smile Moreover this is not very informative since it lacks the time information As a little exercice the dates were converted to number of days elapsed since actual date For this to be possible date recorded as strings were converted to Julian dates since it allows to express them as a single number useful for computing differences between two dates In our cases we will consider Julian day which is the integer part of the Julian date We also need to put date in the first column instead of the second This is easily done by adding an awk filter like this awk printf s dn 2 1 However it is still possible to swap the x and y columns by using toggletransposeaxes The bash script that handles date conversion is called tojulianshhttpwwwaliquoteorgpubtojuliansh An example of use is starttojuliansh 20100312 stoptojuliansh 20110116 echo stopstart bc l So we can pipe our preprocessing steps to the following awk call awk printf d dn systemsh tojuliansh 2 1 or if we want the number of days from now Julian day for 20110114 is 2455576 we can use tojulian2shhttpwwwaliquoteorgpubtojulian2sh which includes minor edits in its output Its use is straightforward tojulian2sh 20110114 0 tojulian2sh 20100114 365 However this wont work as expected because system will return its exit status 0 if success just after 2 A small workaround is to do cat tweetsbydatedat awk cmdtojulian2sh 2 cmd getline dd closecmd printfd dn dd 1 tweetsbydate2dat Ok now the text file looks like 663 1 575 1 558 2 To use graph with these dates we need to reverse the xaxis so that older dates have smaller abscissae As I didnt found any option in graph I just negate the preceding values It is enough to replace printfd dn dd 1 by printfd dn dd 1 when calling awk graph T ps F HersheySans f 0035 S 2 0025 m 0 X Elapsed days Y Frequency plotps graph2img20110117131159png Of course all of the graphical stuff might have been obtained with Gnuplot I have been mainly focusing on the treatment of dates obviously the next step is to process the text data ie text mining In the meantime here is a preview of my tweets as a worddle graph3img20110117134626png In conclusion we have seen how with elementary commands and using at most 10 builtin utilities perl bash awk grep cut uniq sort cat nl bc plus graph we have access to simple but efficient reporting facilities No need to use external statistical software for that Everything is available at the shell prompt Now I agree that Python matplotlib or R ggplot2 would produce far better results at the price of few supplementary line of code In fact everything could have been done directly in Perl 1 It should evolve to enable custom output like date tweet or tweet alone eg

epidemiology","tags":["review"],"href":"/practical-psychiatric-epidemiology","content":"I just read Practical Psychiatric Epidemiology from Prince M Stewart R Ford T and Hotopf M Eds Oxford 2003 There is already a review in The Bristish Journal of Psychiatry 186 268 2005 Hereafter I would like to quote some of the main ideas of this nice textbook on research and methodological aspects of psychiatric epidemiology Although this textbook is mostly dedicated to students in epidemiology or psychiatry which I am not of course it contains a huge amount of useful references and advices to whom may be concerned with the analysis of comparative studies in the biomedical domain The growing interest in geneticrelated studies and the now available statistical methods to deal with largescale surveys or quality of life studies allow for a deeper understanding and takings of mental health problems These emerging issues in psychiatric epidemiology offer a new research area open to interdisciplinary collaboration Basically psychiatric epidemiology is concerned with the study of prognosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders Contrary to more classical epidemiologyepidemiology study on mental health related pathology does not always involve biological events or signals thus emphasizing the need to build questionnaire or dedicated interview that might lead to some useable manifest variables With this in mind some of this work has more to do with usual psychometrics ie the science of the measurement of mental phenomena Generally speaking work related to health care aims at answering three kind of question What is going on Only history taking examination and diagnosis allow the practician to deal with such a question Why Answer to this question may be provided by aetiological research based on transversal or longitudinal studies What do we do about it Answer to this question relies on intervention studies including RCTs but is obviously associated with some ethical problems These topics are treated at length in Section 2 of the textbook which we will resume in a few paragraphs Further quoting Eaton 1986 cited on page 5 Epidemiology is a branch of medicine and thus the assumptions of the medical model of disease are implicit The most important assumption is that the disease under study actually exists In psychiatry this assumption is assuredly more tenuous than in other areas of medicine because psychiatric diseases tend to be defined by failure to locate a physical cause This is just to say that psychiatric epidemiology has to be distinguished from classical epidemiological in the way data can be collected and inference may be drawn Indeed it is not very easy to design a study where we deliberately manipulate risk factors nor when we decide to continue a study that would affect someones welfare Thus studies are mainly of observational nature per se and there we run into problems related to confounding or mediating effects that are often not easily solvable Section 1 is mainly devoted to the history of psychatric epidemiology and the new tools developed so far Most of these statistical apparatus grow on measurement theory which put emphasis on validity and reliability of the measurement of mental processes Such topics are dealt at length by G Dunn in his textbook Statistics in Psychiatry Additionally casecontrol and cohort studies have provided much more interesting results than crosssectional surveys developed in the eighteen century These kind of study design are discussed in the next section but see below Crosscultural issues are discussed in a separate chapter V Patel mainly points to the comparability of psychiatric disorders measurement in different countries whose social and cultural setting may interfere with a direct and clearcut interpretation of the results Section 2 reviews the basic experimental design used to assess or uncover significant marker of mental disorders As shown in the next figure this includes crosssectional casecontrol and cohort or longitudinal studies randomized clinical trials and posthoc or metaanalysis In short the design and analysis of a study aims at maximizing the precision and validity of its findings Avoiding bias or confounding effect is thus the primary goal of any epidemiologist especially because most of the studies under consideration are observational per se Strict control over experimental factors or exposure like in an RCT are thus generally lacking Study designsimg20080427125228png Here are the main advantages and drawbacks of each

Population exposures such as air pollution Efficacy of new interventions Effectiveness of new interventions Hypothesis testing Mechanisms Measures of effect Prevalence Odds ratio Relative risk Correlationregression coefficient Relative riskodds ratiodifference between means Probably the most wellknown designs are the Casecontrol and Cohort design study Casecontrol studies are most appropriate when the disorder under study is i rare ii takes a long time to develop after the exposure sometimes referred to as the latent period and iii where the exposure is common Cohort studies are more appropriate when the disorder is i common ii it does not take long to develop and iii the exposure is rare They both come with their own drawbacks and interpreting the results gathered through such approaches often involves a careful inspection of the hypothetical causal pathways In either case we need to ensure the proper recording of the data as well as appropriate statistical analysis While the former may be facilitate with dedicated software1 care must be taken when analyzing data gathered through complex sampling frame like stratified sampling with unequal sampling weights or cluster sampling Such designs call for specialized software like SAS or Stata though SPSS now has some survey design capabilities since version 15 SJ Pocock gives a nice overview of clinical trials and how to manage them When to stop a clinical trialWhen to stop a clinical trial Section 3 puts emphasis on the reading of data in particular on the relevance of causality in the interpretation of a significant association between symptoms biological or genetical markers and disturbed behavior or mental trouble This is probably the most interesting aspect of such studies and obvisouly the harder one Many software are available for study comparison also known as metaanalysis eg RevmanRevman but read the chapter Software for metaanalysis and publications bias of Publication

correct inference can be done based on the observed results CONSORT chartimg20080501103418png Robert Stewart offers in Chapter 13 an extensive discussion around causal pathways and how inferential

The environment and disease association or causationThe environment and disease association or causation Hill 1965img20080501202234png Causation or causality interpretation are by far the most difficult aspects of epidemiological research Cohort and crosssectional studies might both lead to confoundig effects for example Another set of criteria has been proposed by HB Asher in Causal Modeling Sage 1976 as cited by S Menard Longitudinal Research Sage University Paper 76 1991 The phenomena or variables in question must covary as indicated for example by differences between experimental and control groups or by nonzero correlation between the two variables The relationship must not be attributable to any other variable or set of variables ie it must not be spurious but must persist even when other variables are controlled as indicated for example by successful randomization in an experimental design no difference between experimental and control groups prior to treatment or by a nonzero partial correlation between two variables with other variable held constant The supposed cause must precede or be simultnaeous with the supposed effect in time as indicated by the change in the cause occuring no later than the associated change in the effect While the first two criteria can easily be checked using a crosssectional or timeordered crosssectional study the latter can only be assessed with longitudinal data except for biological or genetic characteristics for which temporal order can be assume without longitudinal data Of course the situation becomes more complex in case of a nonrecursive causal relationship To catch up some of the most useful concepts here is a brief illustration of the main causeeffect relationships one may encounter in an observational study Causalityimg20080511093830png The interested reader could also refer to Chapter 2 of Rothmans Modern Epidemiology 1998 Lippincott Williams Wilkins 2nd Edition2 Finally Section 4

some recent articles from Denny Borsboomhttpsitesgooglecomsiteborsboomdennydennyborsboom Two of them deal with diagnostic and the international classification of diseases from a measurement and conceptual perspectives These are actually really excellent papers as they bring psychometrics in the field of health measurement and diagnostic Psychometric Perspectives on Diagnostic

2010 33 137193 The first paper gives a nice overview of the core idea of the second one It is organized along two main ideas The first deals with three approachesconstructivist dimensional and diagnosticto study and more generally to conceptualize the relation between symptoms and underlying constructs This is nicely summarized p 1098 as Whereas the contructivist view accepts empirical relations between symptoms as a fact but makes no assumptions on the origin of these relations the diagnostic and dimensional views share the idea that the symptoms hang together empirically because they measure the same latent structure This structure is categorical in the diagnostic view and continuous in the dimensional view but in both cases it plays the same role namely it enters in the model as a representative for that which the symptoms measurewhatever it may turn out to be What about measurement theory In fact the diagnostic view can be well represented by Latent Class models while the diagnostic view which conceptualize disorders as continuous attributes rather than discrete classes calls for Latent Trait models or so called liabilitythreshold model The second main idea of that paper is that relations between symptoms can be envisioned as a causal system instead of a latent variable model where in this case their correlations would be a spurious sideeffect of the model conditional on a value of their common cause here an hypothesized latent trait there is no correlation between manifest variables here symptomsthis is basically the hypothesis of local independence Indeed under this model relations between symptoms merely reflects causal effects of some of them onto the others This has obviously strong implications for current I fetched quite all the papers references in the bibliography section and additional papers on IRT models and formative measurement Here is the BibTeXhttpwwwaliquoteorgpubdsmirtbib file In the second paper the author and his coworkers develop along these ideas a network approach to comorbidity which is hypothesized to arise from direct relations between symptoms of multiple disorders contrary to the more classical view where these are comorbid disorders themselves that causes their associated symptoms to correlate as reflected in a latent variable model like factor or item response models where a given symptom would allow to measure a particular disorder In fact symptoms are part of disorder but they dont measure it This a mereological relationship In other words bq The central idea is that disorders are networks that consist of symptoms and causal relations between them In a nutshell what binds say the set of depression symp toms is that they are thus connected through a dense set of strong causal relations With regard to comorbidity such a network approach presents a radically different conceptualization of comorbidity in terms of direct relations between the symptoms of multiple disorders Of course there would be much to say about empirical evidence provided by these authors on major depression and generalized anxiety pp 141143 Interestingly they used a software for network visualizationhttpaliquoteorgmemos20080519networksgraphsandvisualization that I had nevener heard about before Cytoscapehttpwwwcytoscapeorg On a related point I found on Anglique

PythonPython A good starting point for discussion can be found here httpwwwsecnetixdeolliPythonblockindentationhawk but for the time being I will rather focus on the way indentation pattern is checked within Python It is worth remembering that both tabs and soft wrap will honor the definition of a correct indentation level According to the reference documentation but see also PEP 8PEP 8 Leading whitespace spaces and tabs at the beginning of a logical line is used to compute the indentation level of the line which in turn is used to determine the grouping of statements First tabs are replaced from left to right by one to eight spaces such that the total number of characters up to and including the replacement is a multiple of eight this is intended to be the same rule as used by Unix The total number of spaces preceding the first nonblank character then determines the lines indentation Indentation cannot be split over multiple physical lines using backslashes the whitespace up to the first backslash determines the indentation httpdocspythonorgreferencelexicalanalysishtmlindentation For example the following snippet is correctly indented python def perml Compute the list of all

Kluwer Academic Publishers 2001 This emerging field of work extends the frontiers of knowledge in classical epidemiology We can also notice that genetics is becoming a new theoretical framework for several theoretical considerations as well My daily job is not directly concerned with this research topics since Im primarily involved in educational statistics and more classical biostatistics Meanwhile I found useful to gain insight into statistical methods used to assess such subjective patients ratings From a psychometrical point of view they can be considered as reflecting one or more latent variables underlying clearly identifiable constructs Classical Test Theory together with modern Item Response Theory IRT provides valuable addons to the understanding of patient selfassessment Such statistical toolboxes indeed allow to better understand how a person may interact with an item or an items bundle while providing a way to locate the individual onto a criterionbased measurement scale The Rasch Model has been successfully applied by Agnes Hamon in her thesisthesis on QoL questionnaire design She also wrote a review on the use of IRT to validate the SIP questionnaire De la thorie classique la thorie psychomtrique moderneDe la thorie classique la thorie psychomtrique moderne Indeed the Rasch Model quite naturally extends the more traditional or Classical Test Theory framework which is based on the analysis of raw scores Similarly recent advances in QoL studies claim for an extended used of measurement theory Among others IRT provides wellacknowledged methods to assess scores reliability and test construct validity Reliability is a property of the scores delivered to the examinees in an educational context or patients in a biomedical context not of the test itself Bruce Thompson offers an extended discussion about this topic in his recent book Scores reliabilityScores reliability but see his homepagehomepage In the following we shall focus on educational assessment but the same considerations can easily be transfered to the biomedical domain So we speak of reliable scores and scores refer to the underlying measurement purpose of any test or exam This is a way of locating or ranking each candidate with respect to a common continuous or ordinal scale Assigned scores are not immutable nor should they be viewed as an absolute measure of performance or proficiency of a given candidate But one certainly wants to be able to compare the scores obtained by two candidates or to evaluate the progression of a candidate who takes the same test at different occasion Further the scoring process should be as precise as possible One also wants to minimize possible random fluctuations or errors when estimating the score of a candidate Reliability or repeatability concern the random variability associated with such measurements whatever the kind of scores given to candidate binary passfail or discrete marks Thus scores have to be standardized in some way and their interpretation would be valid whenever they are linked onto an external criterion or reference scale The same line of reasoning applies when passfail outcomes are considered In this later scheme the precision of the scoring process is assessed through the accuracy of classification sensibility of the examination Quoting Fayers and Machin validation of instrument is the process of determining whether there are grounds for believing that the instrument measures what it is intended to measure and that it is useful for its intended purpose Different theoretical and practical concepts are subsumed under the very broad notion of validity Some are still debated in the literature eg see J Bonds articlearticle and the list proposed in the following is far from being exhaustive Content validity concerns the extent to which the items are sensible and reflect the intended domain of interest Criterion validity considers whether the scale has empirical association with external criteria such as other established instruments Construct validity examines the theoretical relationship of the items to each other and to the hypothesized scales This is obviously the most amenable to exploration by numerical analysis Two specific aspects of construct validity are convergent validity and discriminant validity Altogether validity and reliabilitybut we could also consider sensibility and responsivenessare strongly interrelated and contribute to the quality of the test or exam under consideration Poor reliability can sometimes be a warning that validity might be suspect and that the measurement is detecting something different from what is intended to be measured As can be seen from the above considerations psychometrics has probably a role to play in the validation of future questionnaire for QoL assessment QoL now extends to internetbased ressources as illustrated by the recent Net ScoringNet Scoring QoL management Online scoring or adaptive testing are also of potential interest for QoL assessment I would like to refer the interested reader to John Uebersaxs website on Latent Class ModelLatent Class Model and other topics related to reliability and assessment Of

to export graph in PDF for example they say little about how to customise the final rendering even if we wait chapter 15 to get a more detailed version of what was already covered at the end of chapter 2 Since publishers are often very stringent regarding graphic pictures dimensions resolution etc I would have expected more technical details on how to set up custom image format and how to

Smits discussed the measurementprediction paradox in a nice paper The Measurement Versus Prediction Paradox in the Application of Planned Missingness to Psychological and Educational

and low interitem correlations because items with high interitem correlations usually explain the same part of the criterions variance hence do not contribute to predictive ability Quoting the authors p 3 So it seems to be impossible to maximize both measurement precision and predictive validity at the same time If measurement is maximized reliability is high interitem correlations are high and as a consequence predictive validity tends to be lower If predictive validity is maximized interitem correlations are low and as a consequence measurement precision tends to be lower This paradox was considered in three classical handbooks for psychological testing Cronbach Gleser 1965 pp 136137 Gulliksen 1950 pp 380381 Lord Novick 1968 p 332 In practice researchers have to make a choice between

peoples general health Public health measures such as sanitation improved hygiene and vaccines reduced hazards in the workplace new drugs and clinical procedures and more recently a growing understanding of the human genome have each played a role in extending the duration and raising the quality of human life But research conducted over the past few decades shows us that this progress much of which was based on investigating one causative factor at a time often through a single discipline or by a narrow range of practitioners can only go so far Genes Behavior and the Social

surgeryhttpwwwaliquoteorgpubRaymond2006SCCpdf European Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery 29 8288 Objective This paper compares four techniques used to assess change in neuropsychological test scores before and after coronary artery by pass graft surgery CABG and includes a rationale for the classification of a patient as overall impaired Methods A total of 55 patients were tested before and after surgery on the MicroCog neuropsychological test battery A matched control group underwent the same testing regime to generate testretest reliabilities and practice effects Two techniques designed to assess statistical change were used the Reliable Change Index RCI modified for practice and the Standardised Regressionbased SRB technique These were compared against two fixed cutoff techniques standard deviation and 20 change methods Results The incidence of decline across test scores varied markedly depending on which technique was used to describe change The SRB method identified more patients as declined on most measures In comparison the two fixed cutoff techniques displayed relatively reduced sensitivity in the detection of change Conclusions Overall change in an individual can be described provided the investigators choose a rational cutoff based on likely spread of scores due to chance A cutoff value of 20 of test scores used provided acceptable probability based on the number of tests commonly encountered Investigators must also choose a test battery that minimises shared variance among test scores Hereby I do a rather quick search on Google and get the following

in psychotherapy researchClinical significance a statistical approach to defining meaningful change in psychotherapy research Following Bain Dollaghan1 a clinically significant change is a change in client performance that 1 can be shown to result from treatment rather than from maturation or other uncontrolled factors 2 can be shown to be real rather than random and 3 can be shown to be important rather than trivial There is also an interesting overview of statistical significance compared to clinical significance and an article wrote by Christensen and published in Prevention Treatment which is available online The Clinical Significance of Neils Couple Therapy ResearchThe Clinical Significance of Neils Couple Therapy Research Basically a reliable change is defined with respect to the reliability of the measurement instrument used to evaluate the patient Obviously the reliability of a given instrument questionnaire inventory etc can be estimated in many ways which leads to the distinction between structural consistency internal consistency or temporal consistency The latter often called testretest reliability may be obtained using a simple intraclass correlation The interested reader is referred to Thompsons textbook3 to fully appreciate the interest of reliability assessment C Evans gives the following formula to estimate a criterion level that would indicate change occurring less than 5 of the time just due to measurement error sigma1timessqrt2timessqrt1Phi where Phi stands for the reliability coefficient This formula originates from Christensen and Mendoza4 after correcting for the fact we are looking at difference between two unreliable measurements hence the square root of 2 used in the above formula Note that Evans also recommends using Cronbach from the observed data or a previous study as an estimate of the measurement reliability Although there is a longstanding debate about the difference between internal vs temporal scores consistency see eg Thompson3 the use of an gathered through previous data is not the best way to ascertain present scores reliability Indeed reliability is a property of scores not of the intrument itself Thus one would get different reliability estimates when using different data from the same measurement device This formula can be implemented without effort in RR For instance r

it is viewed as a change of the patients location with respect to normative or populationbased criterion5 eg its location from the mean 2 SD Other methods include eg standardized regressionbased technique Analysis of covariance might also be useful when one wants to compare a simple change at one period Using the baseline T0 as a covariate we may test for difference between two groups or set of observations Obviously this relies on the assumption that the two groups are comparable in their means at the baseline Another solution is to resort to Latent Growth Modeling LGM but one also talks of Latent Trajectories In this case we are not only modelling the change max min but we are tackling the process of change directly LGM is a longitudinal analysis technique to estimate growth over a period of time For a detailed explanation of such technique please refer to Acock9 or this webpagewebpage which summarizes a number of significant contributions to this field or the supplemental Chapter D of Klines book Principles and Practice of Structural Equation Modeling 1998 Latent Growth ModelsLatent Growth Models This modelbased approach allows to model constant linear accelerating or decreasing change and this trajectory can be compared to controls trajectory Note however that this requires a comfortable sample size as many latent variable models References 1 Bain BA and Dollaghan

googleVishttpcranrprojectorgwebpackagesgoogleVisindexhtml reports and slideshow Beamer or slidifyhttpslidifyorg The point is that everything can be done with RStudiohttpswwwrstudiocom which provides an unified interface to those aspects of data science Even if I am more versed into Emacs and GNU tools for that I must acknowledge that RStudio is really the best software to interact with R in a nonintrusive way read its not a cliquodrome although it is clearly best suited for wide screen display Everything is a text file sums up the essence of my own ideas in the past few years One thing that is missing is package development which is what I believe RStudio is really great for too It may not be always the case that when analyzing data you need to build a dedicated package see my review How to efficiently manage a statistical analysis projecthttpstatsstackexchangecoma3191930 on Cross Validated but RStudio comes with handy tools to develop test and deploy R packages Personally I very much like these books that are available on GitHub First you have the book almost for free I often buy the book not to please the editor but to acknowledge the work and efforts made by the

polishing statistical analyses for a paper including several instruments for neuropsychological assessment I was puzzled by an article where authors reported using Cortinas standard error 1 for Cronbachs alpha I usually give 95 confidence intervals computed by bootstrap with BCA correction and dont rely on asymptotic distribution for this particular statistic The precision of Cronbachs alpha depends on the standard error of items intercorrelations and its SE takes the form fractextSDrsqrtleft12times ktimes k1right1 where SDr is the standard deviation of item intercorrelations and k is the number of items Cortina p 100 It follows that if the intercorrelation matrix is constant SE0 I dont really like the overuse of Cronbachs alpha especially when it is not aknowledged as just a measure of the average betweenitem correlation Cortina just nicely say that precision of alpha because it is a function of the spread of item correlations reflects this range of correlations regardless of the source or sources of the range eg measurement error or multidimensionality If the measurement instrument is clearly multidimensional then it follows that the variance of intercorrelation matrix increases and in turn SE Cortina also points to usual values of alpha considered as absolute thresholds eg 070 I would add 090 for comparison at the individual level Another lesson to be learned from Green et als1977 Monte Carlo study is that alpha either Cronbachs or standardized is a function of the number of items in a scale Although most who use alpha pay lipservice to this fact it seems to be forgotten when interpreting alpha Most recent studies that have used alpha imply that a given level perhaps greater than 70 is adequate or inadequate without comparing it with the number of items in the scale Any perusal of the recent literature in applied psychology supports this statement This acceptance of 70 as adequate is implied by the fact that 70 usually goes uninterpreted It is merely presented and further scale modifications are seldom made This is clearly an improper usage of the statistic A similar point was raised by Schmitt 2 Below I show how Cronbachs evolves as the number of items the average item intercorrelation and the dimensionality are varied It is merely Cortinas Table 2 converted to a more compact chart I didnt add the standard error though img20100924210640png As can be seen lower internal consistencies are found for low number of items low average item correlation and when there is no unidimensionality I happened to produce a similar plot as follows it needs

psimdesigni2statistic resdf Further high reliability is generally cited as evidence of good psychometric properties of a scale However a high estimate of alpha may be indicating the presence of systematic errors These extraneous variables can make a substantial contribution to alpha rather than the actual trait that is being attempted to be measured In particular it has been shown that when the factor loadings of the trait being measured are low the presence of systematic errors can greatly in ate the estimate of alpha especially with large sample sizes A recent paper published in Health and Quality of Life Outcomes even suggests that Cronbachs might be adjusted to take into account inconsistent responses I just skimmed through the paper but the results section looks interesting Contrary to common belief random responses may inflate Cronbachs alpha when their mean differ from that of the true responses Fixed responses inflate Cronbachs alpha except in scales with both positive and negative polarity items In general the bias in Cronbachs alpha due to inconsistent responses may change from negative to positive with an increasing number of items in a scale but the effect of additional items beyond around 10 becomes small The number of response categories does not have much influence on the impact of inconsistent responses References 1 Cortina JM 1993 What Is

trial risk assessment","tags":["readings","statistics"],"href":"/some-caveat-in-clinical-trial-risk-assessment","content":"I recently came across the following article from Applied Clinical Trials Clinical Trials and Statistical TribulationshttpwwwpsymausacomthemespsymaClinical20Trials2020Statistical20TribulationsAttig20and20Clabaughpdf R Brian Attig and Alison Clabaugh Feb 2008 It is about common measures of risk assessment in RCTs and how their inappropriate use might lead to unfortunate interpretation and decision The takeaway message is that Confusion about clinical trial results creates a negative feedback loop that affects all players in the health care system and follows from a critical assessment of a paper published in The New England Journal of Medicine about the adverse effect increased risk of myocardial infarction of Avandiahttpwwwgskfrgskmedicamentavandiahtm However the conclusions were drawn from the analysis of relative risk measurs and did not incorporate an estimate of absolute risk levels The 43 increase in risk comes from an observed oddsratio of 143 but if absolute levels of risks are compared between the treatment and control groups the absolute level of increased MI risk for Avandia patients in these groups ranged from 7100th of 1 to slightly more than 410th of 1 very small effects by any measure See Table 2 Disconnecting RR measures which otherwise sound much more attractive to unexpert reviewers from their baseline level might thus strongly distord the interpretation of anyone findings In sum the authors recommended not using RR or OR in isolation but rather to report two measures of effect size Absolute risk reduction which reflects a baseline event rate for treatment and control groups thus providing a framework for understanding the overall magnitude of risk or benefit as well as impact from the intervention Relative risk reduction which provides an easily understandable and direct means to compare the effect of an intervention on treatment and control groups An alternative way of thinking of the effect of a new drug compared to a standard treatment is to talk of Number Needed To Treat NNT which represents the number of individuals who will need to be treated in order that one of them receives benefit from this new drug In that sense it is simply the reciprocal of Absolute Risk Reduction defined as the difference in event rates between the control and active arms when this quantity is normalized by the proportion of events in the control group it is known as the Relative Risk Reduction And heres a

Mac and now I need to test then but it looks quite interesting at first sight First separating source code from a TeXified report appears mandatory unless you really want to embed your R code within a templating or typesetting system From my experience it only works for small scale project Otherwsie it rapidly becomes very messy to organize all the studd especially dependencies For reporting with clean PDF or HTML output there are SweavehttpwwwstatunimuenchendeleischSweave and brewhttpcranrprojectorgwebpackagesbrewindexhtml For the latest you have to write a template file and analysis might be cycled over different data sets this is very convenient when you have to report statistics per country for instance I am most familiar with Sweave that I used for preparing textbook course notes or results from interim analysis By the way I just found nowebhttpwwwcstuftsedunrnoweb really wonderful as it is not limited to R files I use it when I have to consider more than one programming language eg bash or ruby R or python About organizing our R files several options are available keep them all in a dedicated file eg funcR that will be sourced whenever they are needed or just create an R package Well in this case it seems to me little be hard to imagine that I will create an R package for each statistical project I am involved in At last I can capitalize my code by storing useful and generic functions in one package but it seems each project call for specific addons so I dont see the interest here However documenting each function is a good habit and I use roxygenhttproxygenorg for that purpose I found a useful trick from Brendan OConnorhttpanyallorg on the SO the idea is to load every functions in a dedicated R environment eg r util newenv utilbgrep function utiltimeit function whileutil in search detachutil attachutil This way in the toplevel namespace we wont see them eg through ls and we dont have to use a dot prefix for masking our functions which I ever found a very sad approach On a related idea one proposes to put all functions in a separate folder and load them in a names environment here myfunc using code like r if lengthgrepmyfuncssearch0 attachmyfuncspos2 for f in listfilesfunctionsrfullTRUE syssourcefpostoenvgrepmyfuncssearch Versioning is also worth of attention because we need to keep a trace of what we do especially since I found that statistical analysis often follows a nonlinear time course we start a new project work hard on data cleaning and first exploratory analysis run basic models then we present the intermediate results discuss about other modeling strategies then we are called on another project that has to be updated in few days then we go back to our initial project and find other good ideas to analyse the data etc I often make use of the simple RCShttptldporgHOWTORCS5html system but now I am moving all my code and projects over Githttpgitscmcom Git Magichttpwwwcsstudentsstanfordedublynngitmagic is a good start Obviously in addition to a version control system you need to think of a periodic backup solution When I have to work with distant collaborator I finally find Dropboxhttpwwwdropboxcom the best solution every person involved in the project can access the latest version of a report and check for the R code I produced As there is a rollback option we can ever restore deleted or modified

Berk also coauthored a nice paper on Statistical Inference After Model Selectionhttpwwwstatwhartonupennedu7Eberkrselection20copypdf I did not take a lot of notes while reading the book and I just skim over some of the chapters due to a clear lack of time in recent days tons of papers to read long overdue MSs to finish profiling code and beat my son on our iPhone games smile In my opinion this textbook cannot be used as textbook for a course I would prefer the ESLIIhttpwwwstatstanfordedutibsElemStatLearn by Hastie and coll In fact Berk refers to it almost all the time in his book However I think it is a good complement for someone who already knows ML techniques and want to read a short overview with emphasis added Takeaway message First let me start with some of the conclusions raised by Richard A Berk by the end of the book I am emphasizing part of these quotes If a priori ignorance prevails about the fX as well there may be no sensible hypotheses to test that were posed before the data were examined That sounds well indeed If we dont know the functional relationship between an outcome and the predictors of interest and these are only the predictors we have at hand not necessarily the ones that participate to the data generation process whats the purpose of HT In practice matters are usually worse One will rarely have all of the required predictors and it will be rare indeed for all of them to be well measured Therefore statistical learning applications will more typically be exploratory and descriptive and occasionally be the basis for forecasting This directly follows from the point raised above Some of the tasks where SL might provide good performance discovering unexpected predictors discovering which predictors matter providing useful regression diagnostics exploiting many predictors while avoiding overfitting issues There are important points here in particular the fact that we can use ML techniques as a secondary tool in regression diagnostics I tend to use ML as a way to isolate predictors of interestin a certain sense I am mainly interested in variable screening or feature selectionand not as a way to generate automatic prediction rules But the fact is that an often neglected assumption in GLM is that the functional relationship between Y and X is know and often assumed to be linear such that any departure from this relationship will entail bad error estimate or even incorrect conclusions about model fit This is largely discussed in Harrells textbook Regression Modeling StrategieshttpbiostatmcvanderbiltedutwikibinviewMainRmS Differences in performance that may be of methodological interest may also be of no practical importance I really like this one because it reminds me of the number of papers that just show up how different classifiers are able to generalize on some test data although they are just differing by a small amount of often less than 5 As noted many times there is no substitute for good data The fact that boosting for example can make a weak classifier much stronger does not mean that boosting can make weak data stronger A musthaveinmind rule of thumb Neither the AIC or BIC take into account the number of parameters estimated for earlier models that were considered and rejected Crossvalidation can be compromised when the same dataset is used over and over The independence between the training data and the test data is gradually lost There was a nice series of papers by AnneLaure Boulesteix and coll on overoptimism in ML techniques commonly found in Bioinformatics research paper Boulesteix and Strobl Optimal classifier selection and negative bias in error rate estimation An empirical study on highdimensional predictionhttpwwwbiomedcentralcom14712288985 BMC Medical Research Methodology 2009 985 Boulesteix Overoptimism in bioinformatics researchhttpbioinformaticsoxfordjournalsorgcontent263437extract

litterature on statistical learning is formulated around some fX There is a real mechanism by which the data were generated A key goal of a data analysis is to recover the datageneration function from a dataset more modest goals are likely to be appropriate Perhaps most important one will not have access to all of the requisite predictors let alone predictors that are all well measured In addition various kinds of data snooping will often be difficult to avoid and even the best adjustments for overfitting may prove insufficient Again lets keep honest with what we can do from underpowered studies this is my case at least but try to provide useful summary of the data and provisory conclusions while acknowledging that this is merely in the hope of generating hypothesis that might be assessed prospectively in other studies About data dredging specifically that I addressed in a questionhttpstatsstackexchangecomquestions3252howtocopewithexploratorydataanalysisanddatadredginginsmallsamplestud on statsstackexchangecomhttpstatsstackexchangecom here are two papers that I found

fishhttpwwwccebmedupennedupagescoursesEPI5202006MichelsRosner1996pdf The Lancet 1996 348 11521153 Another error is to undertake statistical inference as part of a statistical learning analysis when the pvalues are not likely to make much sense The pvalues may be wildly misleading because the data are not a random sample or random realization of anything because the statistical learning procedure invalidates the required assumptions andor because the necessary sampling distributions are unknown or not credibly estimated I really like this one because I too often feel that people need to put a pvalue somewhere in a paper just as a way to weigh a given assertion against its alternative Its also a rejoinder to the overused HT framework which often prevails over exploratory data analysis Overview Chapter 1 is an essential read for everyone interested in getting the core idea of regression analysis Interestingly a distinction is made between estimation of the parameters of the functional relationship postulated between Y and X and statistical inference or statistical learning p 7 and 13 Chapter 2 deals with splines and smoothers First after a brief overview of polynomial and natural cubic splines the author describes Bsplines which allow for a cubic piecewise fit while keeping some nice numerical properties before presenting penalzation methods shrinkage ridge regression lasso elasticnet dantzig deriving from the work of Hastie and Zou However I discovered Rodeo which stands for Regularization and Derivative Expectation Operator and is related to adaptive smoothing and the L1 penalization the idea is to apply shrinkage to nonparametric regression in order to discard irrelevant predictors More information can be found in Lafferty J and Wasserman L 2008 Rodeo Sparse Greedy Nonparametric Regressionarxivorgpdf08031709 Annals of Statistics 261 2863 Then comes an extended overview of smoothing splines 24 which do not require that the number and location of knots are known or optimized through some measure of fit They take the general form textRSSflambdasumi1Nleftyifxiright2lambdaintleftftright2dt where is a tuning parameter that can be chosed with common model selection procedures eg by minimizing using Nfold crossvalidation textCVhat flambdasumi1Nleftyihat fiixiright2 which amounts to optimize the tradeoff between bias and variance in the fitted values Examples of use can be found in the mgcvhttpcranrprojectorgwebpackagesmgcvindexhtml package see the gam function and this topic is largely covered in 1 Hastie TJ and Tibshirani RJ 1990 Generalized Additive Models Chapman Hall 2 Wood S 2006 Generalized Additive Models An Introduction with R Chapman Hall Locally weighted regression is another approach built upon nearest neighbor methods instead of the LM framework A wellknow example is the lowess smoother which also depends on a tuning parameter namely the bandwidth ie the total no observations used to fit a local regression line Again a generalized CV statistic can be used to select the optimal one In multivariate settings there also exist some kind of smoothers but now the main problems are a to find a good measure of neighborhood and b to find a good way for visually assessing the results Here the GAM approach highlighted above prove to be the most interesting appraoch The idea is that instead of considering all predictors as in the classical GLM frameworkand when there are numerous we might face the curse of dimensionality issue we will be using linear combinations of them So the conditional mean can be related to the Xj as in the formula bar Ymid X alpha sumj1p fjXj where is the intercept Chapters 4 and 5 are devoted to Bagging and Random Forests The basic ideas are that 1 averaging over a collection of fitted values can help compensate for overfitting and 2 a large number of fitting attempts can produce very flexible fitting functions able to respond to systematic but highly localized features of the data altogether 3 this might break the biasvariance tradeoff pp 169170 I already wrote some stuff on RFs see Visualizing what Random Forests really do"},{"title":"Statistical Models for cross-classified data structures","tags":["statistics"],"href":"/statistical-models-for-cross-classified-data","content":"The following discussion aims at describing statistical tools used to estimate the parameters of multilevel models It is derived from an article published in Methodology1 part of which is briefly extended with additional references and some applications in educational testing There are two main approaches to the estimation of statistical models for crossclassified data structures in the literature on multilevel models likelihoodbasedlikelihoodbased frequentist methods and Markov Chain Monte CarloMarkov Chain Monte Carlo ie MCMC procedures which are based on BayesianBayesian statistics2 The estimation of the parameters in multilevel modeling programs is usually carried out by likelihoodbased frequentist methods that result in maximum likelihood ML estimates These are the iterative generalized least squares IGLSIGLS method the restrictive iterative generalized least squares RIGLS method the expectationmaximization EMEM algorithm There exists specialized software for multilevel analysis and probably the most widely used are MlwinNMlwinN and HLMHLM1 The methods implemented in these programs are designed specifically for estimating hierarchical multilevel models although they can be adapted to fit other models For instance models with crossed random effects can be estimated with ML using ordinary hierarchical multilevel models89 Likewise the EM algorithm can be applied to crossclassified data10 ML estimates for crossclassified multilevel models can also be obtained within the framework of linear mixedeffects models11 This approach will be discussed in the next section with an emphasis on the use of SASSAS and RR for LME fitting In contrast to the previous software LME models are based on the specification of sizable design matrices which require more computing time and may lead to estimation problems in complex data structures MCMC methods represent a different approach to the estimation of crossclassified multilevel models They provide a very general simulationbased approach that can be used to fit many more statistical models than ML procedures A general overview of such capabilities and its implementation within the R framework is provided in R NewsR News March 2006 but see also these additional references For every model parameter a prior distribution is determined that reflects the previous knowledge about the parameter Based on the observed data the posterior distribution which is the analog to the likelihood function in the ML approach is then determined If a noninformative prior distribution is selected ie we have only marginal previous knowledge about the parameter of interest the likelihood function and the posterior distribution will be essentially the same Instead of using a relatively complex joint posterior distribution which is in many cases analytically intractable MCMC simulates the parameters from the conditional distributions usually by means of Gibbs sampling12 or MetropolisHastings sampling13 Again dedicated software are available eg BUGS and WinBUGSBUGS and WinBUGS but see also this article on Bayesian inference using BUGSBayesian inference using BUGS If the simulations of a conditional distribution converge to a stationary distribution the single draws from the conditional distribution can be regarded as realizations of the posterior distribution that forms the central basis for statistical inference for a detailed discussion of assessing convergence in MCMC see 14 This procedure bears some resemblance to bootstrappingbootstrapping15 which facilitates by repeated sampling from the observed data the determination of the empirical sampling distribution of a parameter of interest For Bayesian results the mean median or mode of the posterior distribution is used as a point estimate Comparable to a confidence interval in the frequentist approach the Bayesian credibility interval BCI is based on the 25th and the 975th percentile points of the posterior distribution In contrast to the ML approach the MCMC method not only gives a point estimate and a standard error for every parameter but also provides a distribution of the parameter posterior distribution The two approaches have now been compared in a number of studies For instance in 16 the authors showed that relative to the MCMC method ML has the tendency to underestimate the variance components but that the performance difference between the two methods in terms of the bias of the fixed effects is negligible Another crucial advantage of the MCMC method is that it can be easily generalized to fit more complex multilevel models that might not be estimable in a ML framework with the statistical software packages currently available Reference 1 Ldtke O Robitzsch A Trautwein U Kreuter F and Ihme JM 2007 Are there Test Administrator effects in

activity during the recent years Personal analytics is gaining increased attention and even Apple now provides iPhone users with the iOS Healthhttpswwwapplecomioswhatsnewhealth App However I am more concerned with what information is available directly under my hands namely my computer I very much like Seth Browns Vim Croquethttpwwwdrbunsenorgvimcroquet or Stephen Wolframs blog posthttpblogstephenwolframcom201203thepersonalanalyticsofmylife in this respect Indeed they are using basic tools to analyze raw data stored on their computers Regarding email activity it is almost impossible to get useful statistics from Apple Mail although some alternate Mail clients do provide some basic usage statistics I use both Apple Mail and mu4ehttpwwwdjcbsoftwarenlcodemumu4ehtml under Emacs At my office I often have to fetch and process my emails through Gmail web interface This is not very practical but I have to live with that The mu cheatsheethttpwwwdjcbsoftwarenlcodemucheatsheethtml contains useful queries For example to find all messages that include an image as attachment we can use mu find mimeimage And to find the total number of messages that I sent since the beginning of 2012 I can write mu find maildirsent date2012010120141025 wc l It is possible to display the name of all messages that match a given criteria and to process them with other Unix shell utilities eg mu find date2d1d fieldsl while read filename do cat done Finally the next command allows to view all messages that were sent or received yesterday mu find maildirsent date2d1d exec mu view Since mufind allows to exec anything on the list of messages that are returned by our queries much like GNU find command it is probably easier to start with this construction Now lets compute some simple usage statistics Here I would like to analyze 1 The number of messages that I send from my iPhone compared to those sent from a web browser or my local mailing system 2 The number of replies in my sent folder 3 How my Gmail Archives folder evolve with time 4 How the size of some of my mailboxes evolved with time Here is the answer to the first question mu find maildirsent date5y1d exec grep XMailer awk print 2 sort uniq c sort n r head n 2 2138 Apple 1836 iPhone echo 1836 3974 bc l xargs printf 12fn 046 This suggests that my expectations were quite right and I am currently processing about half of my incoming emails with my iPHone The above command filters out irrelevant mailing software like Sparrow or MailMate that I tried once a while Regarding my reply rate here is what I got using mu find maildirsent date5y1d wc l 7747 mu find maildirsent date5y1d exec grep InReplyTo wc l 5165 echo 5165 7747 bc l xargs printf 12fn 067 Hence two thirds of my outgoing emails are in reply to incoming messages Regarding question 3 I will limit myself to folders I keep in sync on my HD Indeed since Gmail has its own conception of IMAP folders labels are mapped to IMAP mailboxes which means that a message can appear in more than one mailbox in particular the GmailAll Mail mailbox will duplicate all messages that have archived under specific labels I decided to fetch only labelled messages all my messages get a label whether it be by automatic rules or manual settings and only specific mailboxes ls Maildir INBOX aphp cache cea cours

above picture Likewise as I am involved in a MOOChttpgoogldrKW0h I receive lot of messages daily via a Google group However it was a surprise to notice that the activity in my private mailbox dropped suddenly by mid 2011 The overall number of messages I send seems to be around 300500 messages every three months which means that I write around 100 emails a month which is less than I expected Of course this only shows part of my mailboxes and it does not account for the fact that Gmail labels hardly reflect our real activity for instance my sent mailbox includes messages that are associated

baseline data and their pitfalls There might be plenty of other papers on this topic available through Google but these ones focus on RCTs and biomedical research Below is just a few recap of the critical points raised in these papers A brief overview Wang et al1 provide general guidelines for reporting subgroup analysis Based on their insert p 2193 here are those recommendations for researchers intending to publish results from subgroup analysis strict copypaste Abstract Present subgroup results in the Abstract only if the subgroup analyses were based on a primary study outcome if they were prespecified and if they were interpreted in light of the totality of prespecified subgroup analyses undertaken Methods Indicate the number of prespecified subgroup analyses that were performed and the number of prespecified subgroup analyses that are reported Distinguish a specific subgroup analysis of special interest such as that in the article by Sacks et al from the multiple subgroup analyses typically done to assess the consistency of a treatment effect among various patient characteristics such as those in the article by Jackson et al For each reported analysis indicate the end point that was assessed and the statistical method that was used to assess the heterogeneity of treatment differences Indicate the number of post hoc subgroup analyses that were performed and the number of post hoc subgroup analyses that are reported For each reported analysis indicate the end point that was assessed and the statistical method used to assess the heterogeneity of treatment differences Detailed descriptions may require a supplementary appendix Indicate the potential effect on type I errors false positives due to multiple subgroup analyses and how this effect is addressed If formal adjustments for multiplicity were used describe them if no formal adjustment was made indicate the magnitude of the problem informally as done by Jackson et al Results When possible base analyses of the heterogeneity of treatment effects on tests for interaction and present them along with effect estimates including confidence intervals within each level of each baseline covariate analyzed A forest plot is an effective method for presenting this information Discussion Avoid overinterpretation of subgroup differences Be properly cautious in appraising their credibility acknowledge the limitations and provide supporting or contradictory data from other studies if any The papers that are referenced above are Sacks FM Pfeffer MA Moye LA et al The effect of pravastatin on coronary events after myocardial infarction in patients with average cholesterol levelshttpcoursesahcumnedupharmacy5822LecturesCARETrialpdf N Engl J Med 199633510019 Jackson RD LaCroix AZ Gass M et al Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and the risk of fractureshttpwwwnejmorgdoifull101056NEJMoa055218 N Engl J Med 2006 35466983 Erratum N Engl J Med 20063541102 Lagakoss article2 is a short note providing good reminders about the problem of data dredging carrying out further analyses after having seen the data and multiple unprotected comparisons in subgroup analyses especially when testing interaction effects which might be circumvented using simple but overly conservative Bonferroni correction His conclusions are p 1668 Ignorance of the total number of subgroup analyses which ones were prespecified and which were post hoc and whether any were suggested by the data makes it very difficult to interpret the reported results When an interaction test for a baseline variable fails to reach the appropriate threshold for significance conclusions about a differential treatment benefit related to this variable should be avoided or presented with caution Assmanns paper3 is all about the same than the next paper so Ill skip it Reader interested in a shorter version of the next paper might however be interested in reading this one Pocock et al4 focused on the inclusion of baseline data obtained during the random allocation to treatment group and did sort of a metaanalytical review of 50 trial reports published in four major journals in 1997 British Medical Journal 15 RCTs Journal of the American Medical Association 6 Lancet 15 and New England Journal of Medicine 24 Overall 70 reported results from subgroup analyses with up to four baseline factors in 56 of the cases According to these authors baseline data might be used for subgroup analyses covariate adjustment or baseline comparisons Statistical tests for interaction are probably the most useful approach as they allow to directly examine the strength of evidence for the treatment difference varying between subgroups p 2919 but are not used as much as they should authors are reluctant to use them because of the lack of statistical power This is because they recognize the limited extent of data available for subgroup analysis and are the most effective statistical tool in inhibiting false or premature claims of subgroup findings p 2920 Let us concentrate on the last two issues Covariate adjustment aims 1 to achieve the most appropriate pvalue for the treatment difference 2 to achieve an unbiased estimate and confidence interval for the magnitude of treatment difference in outcome or 3 to improve the precision of the estimated treatment difference thus increasing the statistical power of the trial Most importantly what really matters is to adjust for the appropraite covariates p 2927 On the other hand baseline comparability aims 1 to describe the baseline characteristics of the sample of patients included 2 to demonstrate that the randomization has worked well by achieving well balanced treatment groups at baseline 3 to add credibility to the trial results specifically encouraging confidence in unadjusted outcome analyses as being without any serious bias or 4 to identify any unlucky imbalances between treatment groups that may have arisen by chance The paper also considered some case studies to illustrate the above points which make it worth to read as compared to standard textbook The final conclusions of the authors are p 2928 Subgroup analyses are often given too great a prominence and fail to use appropriate methods of statistical inference such as interaction tests There also appears a lack of consistency regarding the use of covariateadjusted analyses perhaps largely because their rationale and statistical properties are poorly understood Though less serious there are also improvements to be made in the reporting of baseline comparisons Further thoughts On a related note the use of prepost data is discussed in Statistical Issues in Drug Development by Senn and I gave some further links in response to a question on statsstackexchangecomhttpstatsstackexchangecom Best practice when analysing prepost treatmentcontrol designshttpstatsstackexchangecomquestions3466bestpracticewhenanalysingpreposttreatmentcontroldesigns I recently came across a nice discussion on the MedStatshttpgroupsgooglecomgroupmedstatsbrowsethreadthread165dd9cf7a6608c0 mailing Credit to Martin Holt referencing Streiner and Normans excellent textbook on Health Measurement Scales Oxford University Press 2008 4th ed As for the original question it was about assessing the effect of interventionin hypogonadal male patients as measured by a change observed on an histology index score 0 to 4 The use of residualized gain scores was not new to me but as always it seems I totally forgot about that approach when replying on statsstackexchangecomhttpstatsstackexchangecom The idea which originated from Cronbach and Furby5 and is an extension of Lord6 and McNemar7 proposals consists in 1 Fitting a regression model to the prepost data 2 Estimating the post score from the regression equation 3 Computing the difference between the observed and predicted post score The takehome message from Cronbachs paper is essentially that using chnage scores obeys a precise research question this was originally framed into problems like learning or growth which are in essence multidimensional aspects of individual developement Gains or differences scores were primarily used pp 7778 1 To provide a dependent variable in an experiment on instruction persuasion or some other attempt to change behavior or beliefs 2 To provide a measure of growth rate or learning rate that is to be predicted as a wayof answering the question What kinds of persons grow learn fastest Here the change measure is a criterion variable in a correlational study 3 To provide an indicator of deviant development as a basis for identifying individuals to be given special treatment or to be studied clinically 4 To provide an indicator of a construct that is thought to have significancein a certain theoretical network The indicator may be used as an independent variable covariate dependent variable etc Cronbach sum up the above as follows p 78 There appears to be no need to use measures of change as dependent variables and no virtue in using them If one is testing the null hypothesis that two treatments have the same effect the essential question is whether posttest Y scores1 vary from group to group Assuming that errors of measurement of F are random F is an entirely suitable dependent variable Last unrelated note KimKang and Weiss8 provides a nice overview of the measurement of individual change in light of IRT models Another discussion might be found on raschorghttpwwwraschorgrmt Transactions Raw Score Nonlinearity Obscures Growthhttpwwwraschorgrmtrmt182ahtm References 1

BioPython","tags":["python"],"href":"/testing-biopython","content":"Following my previous posts on Bioinformatics with Mac OS X ref postbioinformaticswithmacosxmd and Installation of Python scientific packages ref postpythonscientificpackagesmd I just try the BioPython toolbox BioPython is an opensource project based on the same principle as the older BioPerlBioPerl project1 It aims at providing a unified interface to traditional methods for computational molecular biology The question then arises as to whether it conflicts with the BioconductorBioconductor or BioPerl initiative In fact the Bioconductor project provides a set of about 260 packages as of July 2008 that enhance the core RR software Most of them are supposed to integrate a growing collection of statistical tools It is a popular library for microarray analysis since it supports most formats and comes with many graphical tools On the contrary BioPerl or BioPython are thought to be used to manipulate data file organize the information and be interfaced with other programming languages Thus they fulfill their role of universal scripting language and appear very complementary of R biobase Whether to use Perl or Python is then a matter of taste The installation of BioPython is quite easy provided you have easyinstall working properly2 Thus just type sudo easyinstall f httpbiopythonorgDIST biopython at the command prompt or follow the install instructionsinstall instructions on BioPython website Next obviously you will have to read the documentationdocumentation There is also a general paper that describes most of the BioPython functionalities though its more oriented toward a wide audience S Bassi A Primer on Python for Life Science Researchers PLoS Comput Biol 311 e199 1 There is also a BioJava project and a BioRuby project 2 Installing BioPerl on a Mac you may either use Fink eg sudo fink install bioperlpm588 at the command prompt use the cpan interface or follow the instructions on the BioPerl website on how to do it the hard way Further Notes Bioperl needs a working version of GD Installing GD on Mac OS X is welldocumented but you may encounter some difficulties when compiling the source package because of lacking png and jpeg libraries First check that libpnga and libjpega are installed usually in usrlocallib Then update your table of archive using ranlib eg sudo ranlib usrlocalliblibpnga If you now try to compile the gd archive it may produce the expected result and install libgda in the proper directory However if you see a message like ranlib file usrlocalliblibgdagdcacheo has no symbols when issuing sudo ranlib usrlocalliblibgda at the command prompt it means that you have a problem with gdcacheo According to this post the problem lies in the fact that gdcacheo contains no symbols because neither libttf nor libfreetype were included in the build and hence libgd thought the cache was unnecessary Thus you may safely remove the occurence of gdcacheo in the last part of the Makefile line beginning with libgda and try to compile again the source package Dont forget to clean the previous install with sudo make clean before doing a new installation Bioinformatics with Mac

overview of Testlet Response Theory and its ApplicationshttpbitlyNrooI5 by Wainer Bradlow and Wang Cambridge University Press 2007 This book provides a very nice introduction to true score which focus on test scores and item response which focus on item scores theory and discusses the advantages of using testlets as the basis of measurement I like such clear overview of main concepts which form the basis of ones field of study No unnecessary maths just facts good references and supporting examples and nice visual illustrations Lastly I enjoyed reading Chapter 2 of Jenkinsons Measuring Health and Medical Outcomes UCL Press 1994 which offers an historical overview of subjective health assessment A reviewhttpwwwaliquoteorgpubKaplan1996pdf of the book was published in Quality of Life Research Testlets are defined as a group of items related to a single content area that is developed as a unit and contains a fixed number of predetermined paths that an examinee may follow Classical test or true score theory considers the whole test as its fungible unit while IRT models focus on item as the basic unit of analysis The authors recommend a middle path coined test response theory which uses pieces of the test as its unit of measurement that are simultaneously small enough to be usefully adaptive and large enough to maintain some stability Testlets are thought to overcome several limitations of classical linear and adaptive testing forms especially context effects crossinformation unbalanced content robustness order effects as well as usual assumptions made by common IRT models including conditional independance ie the probability of answering a particular item correctly is independent of responses to any of the other items conditional on proficiency which is hard to control in computer adaptive testing Starting with Chapter 3 the authors highlight an interesting and nicely illustrated connection between usual IRT models parameters estimates by marginal likelihhod method and Bayes modal estimates where the maximum likelihood estimator is conceptually the same as a Bayes modal estimatori with an improprer uniform prior on proficiency p 32 In words the posterior likelihood probability of observing a given response pattern as a function of proficiency is obtained by multiplying the corresponding item characteristic curves which describe the probability of endorsingpositively or negativelya given item as generated by the IRT model Of course in order to write the conditional probability of xi given theta and beta ie the likelihood with betaj the item parameter vector aj bj cj for item j as PrximidthetaibetaprodjPrjthetaixijQjthetai1xij conditional independence must hold From a Bayesian perspective the Bayes modal estimate is based on the posterior distribution Prthetamid xipropto Lthetamid xiptheta with p reflecting our knowledge about before observing the results ie the prior distribution The latter is treated as one more item in the estimation scheme and it is multiplied with the likelihood and everything else yielding again the posterior distribution Here the choice of the prior distribution matters when using an uniform prior which basically amounts to say that p takes the same value for all the posterior distribution for will be proportional to the likelihood function If instead of an uniform distribution we use a gaussian distribution there might be more subtle effects on the results In any case we can interpret this prior as the correct answer to the question Are you part of the population whose proficiency distribution is N01 Remember that prior distribution are treated as one supplementary item in this estimation framework References 1 Wainer H and Kiely GL 1987 Item Clusters and Computerized Adaptive

Fonnesbeck always found that using a multiplatform editor is a bad idea but I do not necessarily agree For instance GNU Emacs or Vim runs on all three main OSs and offers an almost similar UI experience and interaction with the system meaning it does not target a particular platform although it should probably be better used on Unxlike system However I think that it is not a good idea to switch between several editors depending on the task at hand we need to use the same software every day to really get used to it and appreciate its pros and cons To sum up I personally tend to use as few applications as possible Usually Im happy and probably most productive with just Emacs a Zshellhttpaliquoteorgmemos20120724upgradingbashandzshonosx sedawk and a combination of GNU

Methods Chapman HallCRC 2006 which summarizes the CARME 2003 conference this conference was a good opportunity to sum up what Ive already learned As I am currently reading some papers on biplots let me summarize the talk that John Gower gave on that particular aspect of data analysis and visualization Basically there are two kinds of information displayed in a biplot individuals and variables Here the concept of approximation is very important A biplot provide an approximation of the relationships when considering all individuals together or all variables together or both It is useful as a tool for visualizing results from multidimensional analysis it is not a multidimensional analysis technique per se There are two kinds of approximation that can be used a by using the least squares properties of SVD or b by representing cases by any form of MDS and then superimposing variables by either a regression method or by super superimposing nonlinear trajectories The use of SVD in CA and data analysed has been recognized long ago eg Belfrani 1873 Jordan 1874 Sylvester 1889 Eckhart Young 1936 Gabriel 1971 and even Horst 1965 Biplots can be used for summarizing results of many techniques of multidimensional analysis the differences between those being most of the times just a matter of how we initially transform the X matrix TransformationTechnique Centre and scalePCA Remove main effectsBiadditive Pearson resiudalsCA RowCol 2CA Withingroup dispersionCVA Dispersion XXFA Dissimilarity XXMDS Constrained regressionRank CANOCO Another important concept that was evocated by Gower was that of Category Level Points CLP that are the Lk points associated to a klevel categorical variable The CLPs give an exact representation in a highdimension space and in the biplot approximation points nearest the different CLPs define convex neighbour which amount to Prediction Regions The talk after was given by Michael Friendly and the slides are available on his website dataviscapapershttpdataviscapapers Just by browsing throughout these pages I found a lot of other interesting stuff The main idea of the talk was to offer a deep overview of the vcdhttpcranrprojectorgwebpackagesvcdindexhtml vcdExtrahttpcranrprojectorgwebpackagesvcdExtraindexhtml and gnmhttpcranrprojectorgwebpackagesgnmindexhtml packages where the second one actually acts as a glue for the two other ones The advantage of gnm over the classical loglin function from the MASS package is that it is formulabased and allows to incorporate various effects in the case of symmetric twobytwo table eg symmetry or quasisymmetry Stphane Dray also gave an interesting overview of available method to combine multivariate and spatial data using the famous triplet notation XQD where X n times p is a data matrix eventually pretransformed and Q p times p and D n times n are distance matrices used to impose a metric on the variables and individual spaces respectively Such an approach baiscally allows two kind of eigendecomposition namely XQXDK KLambda and XDXQA ALambda In the case of the PCA we consider X tfracxij bar xjsj Q mathbbIp and D n1mathbbIn By using a spatial weighting matrix W n times n we are able to add a mathematical representation of the geographical layout of the region under study ie through a connectivity matrix C defined as cij 1 if spatial units i and j are neighbors 0 otherwise and setting up wij tfraccijsumjcij Spatial autocorrelation can then be measured with Morans coefficient or Gearys ratio and statistical significance can be assessed using rerandomization technique The problem is however to consider both aspects multivariate and spatialisation simultaneously The multidimensional aspect can de bealed with any dimension reduction technique like PCA The geographical information can be processed by considering a partition or the use of extra explanatory variables In any case studying spatial patterns amounts to maximize the difference between regions In the case we want to focus on eliciting a partition of the egographical regions we can use Betweenclass analysis where we consider the triplet XQD and Y which is a n times g matrix of dummy variables which a new triplet AQDY where A YDY1YDX A latter approach is PCAIV where we consider a matrix Z n times q of explanatory variables and now work with the triplet hat XQD

New Psychometrics","tags":["readings","psychometrics"],"href":"/the-new-psychometrics","content":"I just read The New Psychometrics Science Psychology and Measurement from Paul Kline Routledge 1998 who made wellaknowledge contributions to a better understanding of standardized measurement in psyschological constructs Although I somehow disagree with his claims regarding the usefulness of modern psychometrics IRT I was pleased to read his clear account of Factor Analysis Chapter 3 Here is a recap of his criteria for sound factor analysis pp 6264 1 Sampling of subjects It is essential in an exploratory factor analysis that a full range of subjects is sampled If the sample is homogeneous for a factor that factor will have little variance and thus not take up its proper place in the factor analysis If for example in a study of personality ann the subjects were bar staff or salespersons who are likely to be highly extraverted extraversion would be greatly attenuated 2 Sampling of variables In an exploratory analysis it is also essential that the full range of variables is sampled Thus in the field of abilities it is certain that many factors have yet to be identified especially those of a practical kind not easily testable with standard current psychometric tests Examples of these would be rapport with horses as in jockeys and a masons skill at splitting bricks with a single blow 3 Sample size Standard textbooks vary on this point However there are two issues to be borne in mind Since one of the aims of a factor analysis is to be able to reproduce from the factor loadings the original correlations it is essential that these are as free of statistical error as possible For this reason alone a sample size of 100 subjects is a desirable minimum However it is also agreed thta the ratio of subjects to variables is important If there are more variables than subjects the factor analysis is meaningless There must always be more subjects than variables However textbooks vary in their recommendations concerning the ideal ratio running from 10 to 1 Nunnally 1978 to 2 or 1 Guilford 1956 Barret and Kline 1981b carried out an empirical study of this problem with a large sample of subjects using the EPQ test They found that with a sample as low as 2 to 1 the main factors were retrieved and beyond 3 to 1 there were no improvements A more recent study by Arrindel and van de Ende 1985 claimed that the critical factor was the number of subjects to factors a ratio of 20 to 1 being required for stability There is no doubt that the greater the number of subjects the more stable and reliable the results are likely to be 4 Principal factor rather than principal component analysis Although Harman 1976 showed that in large matrices there was little difference between component and factor analysis on theoretical statistical grounds factor analysis is to be preferred This is because by the estimating the diagonals in the correlation matrix error variance is eliminated from the factor matrix Furthermore since the factors are estimates rather than the actual factors in the particular matrix they are more likely to be generalisable to other matrices There is some argument as to how these diagonals should be computed and readers are referred to Harman 1976 Gorsuch 1974 or Catell 1978 for excellent discussions of this point 5 Number of factors to rotate Principal component and principal axis factor analysis produce a series of factors of decreasing size as each one is extracted it accounts for less variance than the preceding factor Factors were defined as the linear sums of variables and since each variable has an eigenvalue of 1 any factor with a smaller eigenvalue than this must be of no significance Thus some statistical packages choose for rotation all factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 However it has been shown by Cattell 1978 that such a procedure can in some instances overestimate the number of factors This criterion therefore becomes the lowest bound It is certainly true that no factors should be rotated with eigenvalues less than 1 Cattell 1978 has always argued that selecting the right number of factors is crucial for obtaining simple structure Rotate too many factors and factors split Rotate too few and factors run together 6 Selecting the right number of factors If eigenvalues greater than 1 cannot be relied upon to select the right number of factors what should be done Barrett and Kline 1982 investigated various methods of factor extraction with reference to obtaining the correct number of factors They found that two methods seemed to find the target Cattells 1966b Scree test and the Velicer 1976 method Although the Scree test can be automated it is a subjective method essentially an algorithm which works effectively and it is sensible to use both methods as a check and if different to rotate both sets of factors Many factor analysts prefer the genuine statistical selection of the number of factors offered by factoring using the maximum likelihood method However attractive as this option appears it is not without its own problems The main one is that without a large sample the maximum likelihood estimates are not reliable Krzanowski 1988 7 Choice of rotational procedure Cattell 1978 regards this together with the selection of the right number of factors as the crucial element in obtaining simple structure The need to rotate factors to simple structure arises from the fact that there is an infinity of equivalent mathematical solutions once the preliminary factor analysis has been computed Orthogonal rotations yield uncorrelated factors and many factor analysts regard these solutions as the best the uncorrelated set being necessarily simpler than any others There is no doubt that the best procedure for orthogonal rotation is Varimax rotation Kaiser 1958 and this is contained in most computer packages for factor analysis Cattell 1978 has been one of the main advocates of oblique factors on the grounds than in real life it would be unllikely that causal determinants as he believes factors to be would be uncorrelated Furthermore in allowing factors to take up any position relative to each other each factor can be made as simple as possible using the criteria of simple structure There are many different structures for oblique rotation but studies of different methods in relation to simple structure tend to show that Direct Oblimin Jenrich and Sampson 1966 is highly effective see Harman 1976 Cattell favours his own methods Maxplane followed by Rotoplot but these need considerable skill to operate and have been shown by Harman 1976 to be no better than Direct Oblimin which is now the preferred method of rotation for most factor analysis A good discussion on the same points highlighted above is mirrored on PARE by Costello and Osborne 2005 A critical review of FA applied to psychological studies can be found in Ford et al 1986 Point 3 is also addressed in Falissards book about subjective measures in Health Masson 2008 2nd ed chapter 4 p 54 For a given instrument with five dimensions a sample of 300 subjects allow to estimated principal factors with a 95 CIs of 01 each tail Obviously multivariate normality must hold for this to be correct and confidence intervals for PCA eigenvalues is known to yield unreliable results with low or large sample size MacCallum et al 1999 2001 provide insights into the importance of model error in sample size determination About Points 5 and 6 SPSS rotates all factors according to Kaysers rule unless otherwise specified This is very sad because if the researcher is enclined to trust default option from SPSS he will end up with an overestimated number of true factors in his data set All FArelated functions in R call for the number of factors to estimate or rotate which is a safer choice for the end user To my opinion the better way to handle this problem would be to rely on a close inspection of the scree test with simulated noise data superimposed on the real data aka Parallel analysis as implemented in the psy B Falissard and psych W Revelle packages Note that the same consideration applies to Cronbachs alpha Since it is only a lowest bound for reliability it should not be reported alone With a very large sample say N800 using ML method will almost always lead to reject all factor solutions Point 7 To my knowledge very simple structure is only available in the R psych package References cited in the above text are listed at the end of this article

ThinkBayes2httpsgithubcomAllenDowneyThinkBayes2 targets Python 3 but the book has not yet been updated to reflect the changes I first read How to think like a computer scientist probably the Python version back in the 2000s I really liked Allens approach to exposing soft and hard concepts related to computer science This time the author choose to use Python and discrete mathematics to expose the reader to Bayesian statistics Most books on Bayesian statistics use mathematical notation and present ideas in terms of mathematical concepts like calculus This book uses Python code instead of math and discrete approximations instead of continuous mathematics As a result what would be an integral in a math book becomes a summation and most operations on probability distributions are simple loops But note that even if the author offers to tackle such problems from the perspective of computer science statistical considerations remain an important part of the process even if this yields an approximate solution to a good model1 I think it is important to include modeling as an explicit part of problem solving because it reminds us to think about modeling errors that is errors due to simplifications and assumptions of the model Chapter 1 provides a quick exposition to Bayes theorem described as a way to get from PBA to PAB especially in cases where PAB is not easy to compute I find that the MM problem 16 is a very nice way to introduce bayesian inference in the spirit of Philip Goods introduction to permutation testing Permutation Parametric and Bootstrap Tests of Hypotheses Springer 2005 define the problem set up the hypotheses and a test statistic and finally assess the likelihood of the observed result or as the author suggests in Chapter 3 1 choose a representation for the hypotheses 2 choose a representation for the data and 3 write the likelihood function The next one is about the Monty Hall dilemma and it is really trickier2 It is however easy

1948 the first randomized controlled trial was published by the English Medical Research Council in the British Medical Journal Until then observations had been uncontrolled Initially trials frequently did not confirm hypotheses to be tested This phenomenon was attributed to little sensitivity due to small samples as well as inappropriate hypotheses based on biased prior trials Additional flaws were being recognized and subsequently were better accounted for carryover effects due to insufficient washout from previous treatments time effects due to external factors and the natural history of the condition under study bias due to asymmetry between treatment groups lack of sensitivity due to a negative correlation between treatment responses etc Such flaws mainly of a technical nature have been largely implemented and lead to trials after 1970 being of significantly better quality than before The past decade focused in addition to technical aspects on the need for circumspection in planning and conducting of clinical trials As a consequence prior to approval clinical trial protocols are now routinely scrutinized by different circumstantial organs including ethic committees institutional and federal review boards national and international scientific organizations and monitoring committees charged with conducting interim analyses The present book not only explains classical statistical analyses of clinical trials but also addresses relatively novel issues including equivalence testing interim analyses sequential analyses metaanalyses and provides a framework of the best statistical methods currently available for such purpose This book is not only useful for investigators involved in the field of clinical trials but also for students and physicians who wish to better understand the data of trials as published currently Maybe my preferred textbook because it is composed of a lot of chapters 47 in the fourth edition that cover a broad

accent on error estimation model accuracy power analysis Aliferis CF Statnikov A Tsamardinos I Schildcrout JS Shepherd BE and Harrell FE Jr 2009 Factors Influencing the Statistical Power of Complex Data Analysis Protocols for Molecular Signature Development from Microarray Datahttpwwwplosoneorgarticleinfo3adoi101371journalpone0004922 PLoS ONE 43 e4922 Background Critical to the development of molecular signatures from microarray and other highthroughput data is testing the statistical significance of the produced signature in order to ensure its statistical reproducibility While current best practices emphasize sufficiently powered univariate tests of differential expression little is known about the factors that affect the statistical power of complex multivariate analysis protocols for highdimensional molecular signature development MethodologyPrincipal Findings We show that choices of specific components of the analysis ie error metric classifier error estimator and event balancing have large and compounding effects on statistical power The effects are demonstrated empirically by an analysis of 7 of the largest microarray cancer outcome prediction datasets and supplementary simulations and by contrasting them to prior analyses of the same data ConclusionsSignificance The findings of the present study have two important practical implications First highthroughput studies by avoiding underpowered data analysis protocols can achieve substantial economies in sample required to demonstrate statistical significance of predictive signal Factors that affect power are identified and studied Much less sample than previously thought may be sufficient for exploratory studies as long as these factors are taken into consideration when designing and executing the analysis Second previous highlycited claims that microarray assays may not be able to predict disease outcomes better than chance are shown by our experiments to be due to underpowered data analysis combined with inappropriate statistical tests Harrell FE Jr Margolis PA Gove S Mason KE Mulholland EK Lehmann D Muhe L Gatchalian S and Eichenwald HF 1998 Development of a clinical prediction model for an ordinal outcome the World Health Organization Multicentre Study of Clinical Signs and Etiological agents of Pneumonia Sepsis and Meningitis in Young Infants WHOARI Young Infant Multicentre Study Grouphttpwwwlccumaesjjarecidiva064pdf Statistics in Medicine 178 90944 This paper describes the methodologies used to develop a prediction model to assist health workers in developing countries in facing one of the most difficult health problems in all parts of the world the presentation of an acutely ill young infant Statistical approaches for developing the clinical prediction model faced at least two major difficulties First the number of predictor variables especially clinical signs and symptoms is very large necessitating the use of data reduction techniques that are blinded to the outcome Second there is no uniquely accepted continuous outcome measure or final binary diagnostic criterion For example the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is illdefined Clinical decision makers must identify infants likely to have positive cultures as well as to grade the severity of illness In the WHOARI Young Infant Multicentre Study we have found an ordinal outcome scale made up of a mixture of laboratory and diagnostic markers to have several clinical advantages as well as to increase the power of tests for risk factors Such a mixed ordinal scale does present statistical challenges because it may violate constant slope assumptions of ordinal regression models In this paper we develop and validate an ordinal predictive model after choosing a data reduction technique We show how ordinality of the outcome is checked against each predictor We describe new but simple techniques for graphically examining residuals from ordinal logistic models to detect problems with variable transformations as well as to detect nonproportional odds and other lack of fit We examine an alternative type of ordinal logistic model the continuation ratio model to determine if it provides a better fit We find that it does not but that this model is easily modified to allow the regression coefficients to vary with cutoffs of the response variable Complex terms in this extended model are penalized to allow only as much complexity as the data will support We approximate the extended continuation ratio model with a model with fewer terms to allow us to draw a nomogram for obtaining various predictions The model is validated for calibration and discrimination using the bootstrap We apply much of the modelling strategy described in Harrell Lee and Mark Statist Med 15 361387 1998 for survival analysis adapting it to ordinal logistic regression and further emphasizing penalized maximum likelihood estimation and data reduction Harrell FE Jr Lee KL and

Statistics in Medicine 154 36187 Multivariable regression models are powerful tools that are used frequently in studies of clinical outcomes These models can use a mixture of categorical and continuous variables and can handle partially observed censored responses However uncritical application of modelling techniques can result in models that poorly fit the dataset at hand or even more likely inaccurately predict outcomes on new subjects One must know how to measure qualities of a models fit in order to avoid poorly fitted or overfitted models Measurement of predictive accuracy can be difficult for survival time data in the presence of censoring We discuss an easily interpretable index of predictive discrimination as well as methods for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities Both types of predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or crossvalidation before using predictions in a new data series We discuss some of the hazards of poorly fitted and overfitted regression models and present one modelling strategy that avoids many of the problems discussed The methods described are applicable to all regression models but are particularly needed for binary ordinal and timetoevent outcomes Methods are illustrated with a survival analysis in prostate cancer using Cox regression"},{"title":"Time to

know what software they use but I guess it is based on some derivative of Common Lisp CL I spent some time figuring out how to get a fully working Lush system including compiled C code For the moment it failed for the Function Compilation part that is everything related to dhcmake I was initially thinking this was a problem related to architecture management under OS X but it appears this is more serious than this According to this thread Problems with Lush in OsX Snow Leopardhttpsourceforgenetprojectslushforumsforum106861topic3535253 the Lush dynamic loader is built around libbfd which doesnt support MachO So the Lush dynamic loader doesnt work and the compiler is rendered useless Library files that dont have a dhcmake no compiled code will load fine but those that do will crash Indeed

learning","tags":["readings","statistics"],"href":"/twenty-canonical-questions","content":"Here are twenty canonical questions when using learning machines according to Malley and coauthors Malley JD Malley KG and Pajevic S Statistical Learning for Biomedical Data Cambridge University Press 2011 1 Are there any overarching insights as to why or when one learning machine or method might work or when it might not 2 How do we conduct robust selection of the most predictive features and how do we compare different lists of important features 3 How do we generate a simple smaller more interpretable model given a well fitting but much larger one that fits the data very well That is how do we move from an inscrutable but highly predictive learning machine to a tiny familiar kind of model How do we move from an efficient black box to a simple open book 4 Why does the use of a very large number of features say 500K genetic expression values or a million SNPs very likely lead to massive overfitting What exactly is overfitting and why is it a bad thing How is it possible to do any data analysis when we are given 550009 features or 12 million features and only 132 subjects 5 Related to 4 how do we deal with the fact that a very large feature list 500K SNPs may also nicely predict entirely random permuted outcomes of the original data how can we evaluate any feature selection in this situation 6 How do we interpret or define interactions in a model What are the unforeseen or the unwanted consequences of introducing interactions 7 How should we do prediction error analysis and get means or variances of those error estimates for any single machine 8 Related to 7 given that the predictions made by a pair of machines on each subject are correlated how do we construct error estimate comparisons for the two machines 9 Since unbalanced groups are a routine in biology for example with 25 patients and 250 controls 10 Can data consisting of a circle of red dots one group inside an outer circle of green dots a second group ever derive from a biologically relevant event What does this say about simulated data 11 How much data do we need in order to state that we have a good model and error estimates Can classical 12 It is common that features are quite entangled having highorder correlation structure among themselves Dropping features that correlated with each other can be quite mistaken Why is that How can very weak predictors acting jointly still be highly predictive when acting together 13 Given that several models can look very different but lead to nearly identical predictions does it matter which model is chosen in the end or is it necessary to choose any single model 14 Closely related to 13 distinct learning machines and statistical models in general can be combined into a single larger and often better model so what combining methods are mathematically known to be better than others 15 How do we estimate the probability of any single subject being in one group or another rather than making a pure 01 prediction Doctor you say I will probably survive five years but do I have a 58 chance of survival or an 85 chance 16 What to do with missing data occurring in 3 of 500K SNP dataset In 154 of the data Must we always discard cases having missing bits here and there Can we fill the missing bits and still get to sound inference about the underlying biology 17 How can a learning machine be used to detector definebiologically or clinically important subsets 18 Suppose we want to make predictions for continuous outcomes like temperature Can learning machines help here too 19 How is it that using parts of a good composite clinical score can be more predictive than the score itself 20 What are the really clever methods that work really well on all data I must say I found these questions interesting although the authors do not fully address some of them in this textbook I mean they are merely put as guidelines to further study the field of ML for biomedical research in my opinion Anyway I think starting an applied ML course with these questions might be very stimulating for people knowing nothing about large and imbalanced data set overfitting SVMs or Random Forests etc I am currently reading Applied Predictive Modeling hereafter APM by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson This is a nice book which serves as a good companion to their R package carethttpcranrprojectorgwebpackagescaret I have been using this package for 4 years now but I understand its architecture better now that I am progressing through APM chapters Like Statistical Learning for Biomedical Data the authors do not always provide an indepth treatment of ML algorithms or statistical properties but we feel confident that they really know what they are talking about and the reader is gently explained why some methods are better suited than others and what are the interest and limits of using specific predictive models to answer a

means that the compilation went fine but the colored backgrounds werent there After googling for a possible Metapost bug with the newly released ConTeXt engine I just realized that the Texlive2009 distribution does not actually include a useable Mark IV engine The most important motivation for this page is that the TeX Live 2008 edition contains Mark IV but it is only copied to the installed

while subset provides me with most of what I need to filter observations and variables in a working data frame Since Hmisc and rms enhance those functionalities I was quite happy It turns out that

never spent too much time in plyr or ggplot2 because at some point I felt that it was too much at an angle with base R I like that a programming language exhibits some kind of internal consistency and these new packages introduced too much new vocabularies Well ok internal consistency is not the best way to think about R contributed packages Im not speaking of core packages and as discussed by Max

tested them In fact ANOVA is performed in the same way as linear regression ie as linear models no ANOVA table no posthoc tests etc At least visualization of model residuals is there It is rather expensive and of course should be unlocked through App Store One positive aspect of this software is that it allows to work with different datasets at the same time and it can import Stata SPSS or R data files Things I dont like really much is how it enforces a constrained view of the data at hand However given its purposeData Analysis for the NonStatisticianit is already a good thing to offer visual displays for summary statistics and model fits in a systematic manner Some months ago I also tested SOFAhttpwwwsofastatisticscom Statistics Open For All which is crossplatform and open source Its much bigger in size 1392 Mo compared to 49 Mo for Wizard but it is based on Python with an SQLite backend so you can even check how computations are done And of course its free SOFAimg20120926195753png The number of tests that are available is rather limited as shown below Theres a wizard to help the beginner choose between different tests depending on the question of interest but obviously it wont tell you what to do with a response variable having ordered response categories SOFA Wizardimg20120926195815png I found that running a simple ttest for independent samples was quite long even though the dataset in use was quite limited 4699 records SOFA sample ttestimg20120926195915png In both cases Im seriously missing the ability to write commands myself and have to rely on push buttons and menus I understand that this is what is supposed to make these statistical packages so friendly but well it looks like only Statahttpstatacom succeeded in providing both a handy set of menudriven utilities and a commandline From my limited experience JMPhttpwwwjmpcom is really great for interactive data visualization and it includes main techniques for statistical modeling but its scripting facilities are too cryptic to me at first sight because I really did not investigate this much Contrary to SAS it is available for Mac users which is a great thing as it can import SAS and SPSS databases without difficulty Another application for interactive statistical analysis is Data Deskhttpwwwdatadeskcom Initially Data Desk was also a Maconly application but it has been made available for Windows users 15 years ago It is a really nice tool that allow to visualize multivariate dataset with brushing and linking in quick steps It supports some basic techniques for statistical modeling like linear and nonlinear regression I think it should have been a serious addon in the 90s Now we have GGobihttpwwwggobiorg or the new Qt interface cranvashttpsgithubcomggobicranvas and the like which offers almost exactly the same with projection pursuit multidimensional scaling and a conneciton with R This is the reason why I never bought Data Desk Data Deskimg20120926201644png The problem with socalled userfriendly packages to data analysis is always the same what if I tell you that two records were inadvertently inserted in your data and that you must redo everything If you havent recorded each step somehow then you just have to go through each button and menu again This is the problem with statistical UIs that dont offer any way to store your commands and replay them at any time and Im not even talking about reproducible research Im just talking about how to manage statistical projects in an economical albeit efficient manner"},{"title":"Using bootstrap in cluster analysis","tags":["statistics","rstats"],"href":"/using-bootstrap-in-cluster-analysis","content":"Lastly I came again across a nice poster from Tom Nichols that was presented at the OHBM2010 conference This was about Finding Distinct Genetic Factors that Influence Cortical Thicknesshttpwww2warwickacukfacscistatisticsstaffacademicresearchnicholspresentationsohbm2010nicholsohbm2010CoheritabilityClusteringpdf and the clustering method that was used was interesting Apart from choosing the right metric parametric bootstrap was used to assess the stability compactness and separation of clusters as measured with the silhouette width The need for a validation procedure aims at addressing the following two issues in cluster analysis 1 bias toward particular cluster properties and 2 nonsignificance of results when therere no true clusters A more complete review of cluster validation techniques is available in Handl et al 1 see also httpdbkgrouporghandlclustervalidationhttpdbkgrouporghandlclustervalidation Basically the authors established a distinction between three kind of criteria that we want to optimize to get a good partitioning compactness small withincluster variation connectedness neighbouring data belong to the same cluster and spatial separation must be combined with other criteria like compactness or balance of cluster sizes As part of a large battery of internal measures of cluster validity ie we do not use additional knowledge about the data like some a priori on class labeling they can be complemented with socalled combination measures for example assessing intracluster homogeneity and intercluster separation like Dunn or DaviesBouldin index silhouette width SDvalidity index etc but also estimates of predictive power selfconsistency and stability of a partitioning how well distance information are reproduced in the resulting partitions eg cophenetic correlation and Huberts Gamma statistic Ultimately there exist dedicated measures for correlated data which has some obvious applications in genomic studies Well theres much more to read in this paper especially the benchmark study In what follows I setup a simulation study where I look at the evolution of various validity indices as well as the cophenetic correlation and average silhouette width following hierarchical clustering My dataset consists in three well isolated clusters simulated on a 2D plane as follows r simxy functionn mean sd cbindrnormn mean1 sd1 rnormn mean2sd2 xy rbindsimxy100 c00 c22 simxy100 c250 c42 simxy100 c1255 c32 Here is how it looks xyimg20110519084053png I generally fix my seed at a value of 101 if one is interested in reproducing the results Then the main loop just capture the relevant output from clusterstats in the fpc package Silhouette width are computed from the cluster package r dat xy n nrowdat B 20 k seq220

hclustdd methodward for i in k reshc2bi1 asnumericunlistclusterstatsdd cutreehc i G2TRUE G3TRUEstat Each outer loop tooks about 230 to complete so this is rather long but I havent much time to invest in optimizing or distributing the code Obviously this would be better to use say 100 or 500 boostrap samples Anyway here are the results for all eight indices where the true number of clusters is highlighted in red Here is however a complete experiment on 500 bootstrap samples when just estimating average silhouette width for a varying number of clusters swimg20110519084106png Clearly the maximal value is reached for k 3 and we can observe that when k 6 theres a large variability in silhouette widths whereas for k 7 the results are monotonically increasing with few withinessay variability For the same experiment the cophenetic correlation exhibits the following variations Min 1st Qu Median Mean 3rd Qu Max 07678 07900 07951 07947 08006 08123 Its distribution is shown in the next figure img20110519130921png So what can we conclude from this Overall the silhouette criteria as well as G2 and G3 indices work well although in the latter case it is difficult to tell whether its extremal value really distinguishes from simple noise we would need more bootstrap samples probably The Dunn index is not that reliable as it highlights a very large variance at the optimal solution The withincluster SS and consequently the withinbetweenSS ratio show a clear pattern exponential decrease when increasing the number of clusters although in this particular case it might well be explained by the characteristic distributions choosen for our 2D clouds of points Finally the Calinksy criteria seems to work too although with high variance But I have had varying experience with its use a quality of clustering measure because it largely depends on the balance in cluster size I replicate cluster analysis using the kmeans algorithm and the Gap statistic for selecting the number of clusters There was a package SLmisc that handled all that but it not on CRAN anymore It needs to be installed by hand So basically I choose 10 random starting configuration and let the algorithm stop when textGapk textGapk1 sk1 ge 0 where sk1 is the standard error of the simulated results or kmax10 is reached which never happened The results are shown in the next figure kmimg20110519155608png As can be seen using the elbow criteria would lead to retain a threecluster solution Finally turning back to hierarchical clustering I also tried the clusterboot function from the fpc package As described in Hennig 3 and the online help Assessment of the clusterwise stability of a clustering of data which can be casesvariables or dissimilarity data The data is resampled using several schemes bootstrap subsetting jittering replacement of points by noise and the Jaccard similarities of the original clusters to the most similar clusters in the resampled data are computed The mean over these similarities is used as an index of the stability of a cluster other statistics can be computed as well The syntax I used was r hcboot clusterbootdistxy B20 bootmethodboot clustermethoddisthclustCBI methodward cutnumber k3 showplotsTRUE and I saved the plot as separate PNGs before converting them to an animated GIF with ImageMagick It would have been better to set fixed values for the x and yaxis ticks though imgclusterbootgif r Number of clusters found in data 3 Clusterwise Jaccard bootstrap mean 1 10000000 09192952 09193784 dissolved 1 0 0 0 recovered 1 20 20 20 As can be seen the Jaccard similarity value is largely above 090 which means that resampled units are generally found to belong to the same cluster There are many other settings that might be explored I can think of varying the sample size varying the shape of the variancecovariance matrices using a larger number of variables and preprocess them with some kind of feature selection algorithm etc References 1 Handl J Knowles J

when reading articles and book chapters about RFs I would like to show some simple way to graphically summarize how RFs work and what results they give Some time ago there was a questionhttpstatsstackexchangecomquestions2344bestwaytopresentarandomforestinapublication on statsstackexchangecomstatsstackexchangecom about visualizing RFs output Well in essence the responses were that it is not very useful as a single unpruned tree is not informative about the overall results or classification performance Yet there may be some cases where showing how trees are built and how similar they are might be of interest especially for the researcher or physician who isnt that used to ML techniques Although I will not provide a working illustration to this specific question we can still play with simple decision trees and shuffle the dataset onto which they are evaluated In short we can apply some sort of bagging Some properties of RF Why are RFs so attractive now Basically RFs retain many benefits of decisions trees while achieving better results and competing with SVM or Neural Networks In short RFs handles missing values and mixed type of predictors continuous binary categorical it is also well suited to highdimensional data set or the n ll p case Contrary to classical decision tree there is no need to prune the trees to overcome overfitting issues because the RF algorithm takes care of providing biasfree estimate of test error rate There are indeed two levels of randomization first we select a random subset of the available individuals then we select a random subset of the predictors typically sqrtk or k3 for classification and regression respectively It is also worth noting that RFs can be used in unsupervised as well as supervised mode In contrast pruning must be used with decision trees to avoid overfitting this is done by achieving a tradeoff between complexity ie tree size and goodness of fit ie node impurity Decision trees are only applicable within a supervised context In addition to the dedicated websitehttpwwwstatberkeleyedubreimanRandomForests here are important publications by Leo Breiman and coll Breiman L Friedman J Olshen R and Stone C 1984 Classification and Regression Trees Chapman Hall Breiman L 1996 Bagging predictors Machine Learning 26 123140 Breiman L 2001 Random Forests Machine Learning 451 532 Breiman L 2001 Statistical modeling The two cultures Statistical Science 163 199231 Some recent articles or chapter books are also given in the references section The main features of RFs are that we end up with estimates for 1 the test error through the use of outofbag samples this is basically how bagging works just select with replacement a subset of all individuals and a majority vote classification or average regression scheme 2 the importance of each predictor by randomly permuting the predictors and computing the increase in OOB estimate of the loss function 3 the measure of individuals proximity by keeping track of the number of times any two samples xi and xj end up in the same terminal node We said that RFs share some resemblance with bagging but this is not the case of boosting With boosting we would consider all features at the same time and not a subset thereof and tree building would be chained whereas in RF each tree are built independently one to the other This is particularly interesting because it means that the RF algorithm can benefit from paralellization Moreover with highdimensional data set where the number of predictors is largely over the number of samples boosting will be slower compared to RF A wellknown example of boosting is Gradient Boosting Machine For further discussion please refer to Chapter 10 of The Elements of Statistical LearninghttpwwwstatstanfordedutibsElemStatLearn that should makes it clear that Boosting has few to do with bagging It is also worth noting that some authors argued that RFs actually perform as well as penalized SVM or GBM1 An illustration of bagging with classification trees We will use the randomForesthttpcranrprojectorgwebpackagesrandomForestindexhtml R package which conforms to the original algorithm proposed by Breiman Here is how we fit an RF model to the wellknown iris dataset r datairis libraryrandomForest setseed71 irisrf randomForestSpecies datairis importanceTRUE printirisrf and

cutoff considered for splitting each node varies from one trial to the other but overall the tree structure appears to be relatively stable well this is also a school case It should be noted that we didnt consider a random subset of the variables of interest when growing a tree and that we dont collect class membership predicted on OOB data Finally we dont apply the permutation scheme used in RF to assess variable importance so this really is a toy example but it can be extended without any difficulties In particular there is a tree extractor in the randomForest package see helpgetTree Note that it is a raw data frame so we still need to build a wrapper function around that information to produce an object of class tree There are a lot of other packages to explore including

StatWeavehttpwwwstatuiowaedurlenthStatWeave with R and Stata StatWeavehttpwwwstatuiowaedurlenthStatWeave is yet another way to weave code chunks and text into a single document The idea of interlacing

Lynda Walsh and John Shipman Lightweight Literate Programming a Documentation Practice Technical Communication Vol 55 No 1 2337 February 2008 For R we already have SweavehttpwwwstatunimuenchendeleischSweave and its variants but see the CRAN Task View on Reproducible ResearchhttpcranrprojectorgwebviewsReproducibleResearchhtml I used it a lot for preparing my courses handouts and slides with beamer But in the meantime I rediscovered nowebhttpwwwcstuftsedunrnoweb which is closer to the web software and more general in some sense I know Luke Tiernayhttpwwwcsuiowaeduluke is using it for documenting his R projectshttpwwwcsuiowaedulukeR and I once found a very pretty document by Jason Catena using Tufte LaTeX class together with noweb Study Haskellhttpsdldropboxcomu502901haskellpdf I grabbed the statweave jar file a long ago but never tried it for real Now following a question on texstackexchangecomhttptexstackexchangecomquestions16398probleminstatweave I reinstalled it and try to process some R and Stata document Well I dont think Id pushed it to the limits but at first sight it is quite straightforward to get a running PDF in few commands What I like is that it works with Stata on my Mac1 Here is a sample R document rdocimg20110422183131png and here is one with Stata commands statadocimg20110425170528png The idea is as simple as that of Sweave you include code chunks in a dedicated environment here it starts with beginXXcode and stops with endXXcode where XX stands for the foreign language The Stata example reads documentclassarticle usepackageStatweave begindocument StataweaveOptsprompt sectionStatWeave example using Stata Here are some fake data beginStatacodelabelsummarysaveout sysuse auto clear summarize mpg endStatacode Here is the result recalloutsummary enddocument Nothing really difficult in terms of syntax The configuration of Statweave is also easy I just changed the default setting for Stata before noticing that everything was already in the online help RTFM So only the first item in the configuration dialog has to be update in order to reflect the location of your Stata executable stataoptimg20110425171416png It seems to be possible to use Matlab and Maple I will try to configure StatWeave to accept Octave code instead of Matlab that I dont use anymore since the end of my PhD 1 To run Stata from the command line directly you just have to symlink the statase executable into your usrlocalbin directory and to add Stata directory to your path eg export PATHApplicationsStata10SPATH"},{"title":"Weaving Stata

StatatestswvhttpwwwdivmsuiowaedurlenthStatWeaveteststexStatatestswv The Statweave package offers some handy customizations like code formatting see StataweaveOpts and basically all we need to do is to put our Stata code in a Statacode environment For R we would use a Rcode environment Like with SweavehttpwwwstatistiklmudeleischSweave we can display or hide the code and ask Statweave to generate a figure like shown in the following example latex beginStatacodefig hide height45in width9in dispw4in predict ghat twoway scatter gp100m disp line ghat disp sort byforeign endStatacode The STATWEAVE Users ManualhttpwwwdivmsuiowaedurlenthStatWeaveStatWeavemanualpdf has more informations on running and customizing StatWeave I think it should not be too difficult to create languagespecific files for eg Juliahttpsjulialangorg or gslshellhttpwwwnongnuorggslshell Context filter Nowadays the Context filterhttpsgithubcomadityamfilter module allows to call external programs like R pandoc or Asymptote and insert their results into our TeX document Thats really awesome because it means that we can build dynamic documents that keep in sync with accompanying code or simulation la Sweave There are nice demos in the tests directory in the abobe Github repository I tested the R weaving option and it works quite well although I noticed two minor points a a proctime command is issued at the end of each R chunk and b we have to explicitly ask to save graphics before embedding them in our document The first issue is easily solved by modifying the filtercommand latex filtercommandR CMD BATCH q notiming externalfilterparametermode externalfilterinputfilespace externalfilteroutputfile Adding notiming will ensure R will exit without printing elapsed time I added another option externalfilterparametermode which allows to write things like latex startRmodeslave summaryx stopR to get results returned by R only well its a bit crappy but it works The second issue should easily be solved by saving all graphics into a single PDF file and using externalfigure command with a page option This is what I use with LaTeX and it works quite well So we could add something like latex startRreadno pdffigspdf stopR at the beginning of our document and a devoff command at the end This way we just have to call externalfigure while incrementing page number after each call What about Stata A basic filter would look like stata q b do externalfilterinputfile which tells Stata to process externalfilterinputfile do file in batch mode Again there are some caveats with the above command it will leave something like end of do file as well as a leading Stat prompt at the end of the Stata code chunk I wrote a small Bash script to postprocess Stata do file available as a Gist It has few options keep only results ie remove Stata commands andor tidy up the log file by removing extra blank lines If the do file includes graph export commands they are removed as well Almost everything is done with sed ctxstata h Usage usrlocalbinctxstata hst file This script asks Stata to process a do file and log its output OPTIONS h help show this message s slave slave mode discard Stata command t tidy remove all empty lines I defined the following filter latex defineexternalfilter Stata filtercommandctxstata externalfilterparameteroption externalfilterinputfile outputexternalfilterbasefilelog readcommandtypefile colortypecolor cacheyes labelyes spacebeforebig spaceafterbig continueyes For an unknown reason it works for printing Stata code and results but it fails rendering images So the

R users This is a very comprehensive textbook with illustrations in R I already dropped some words two years ago in How to efficiently manage a statistical analysis project People with little knowledge of R can skip chapter 2 and go directly to chapter 3 which goes to the heart of the problem How to create and manage a statistical project in R In few words Dont only rely on copypaste for executing commands write one or several R scripts and source them from a master file Use relative not absolute paths Prefer possibly nested functions to series of commands they take arguments and have returned values hence we can control potential sideeffects Take care of random number generation setseed etc Make use of comments extensively at the beginning of each function anywhere in your scripts to document non obvious steps or indicate brief history of earlier attemps for example Choose variable names with care short but not too short Chapter 5 is about data manipulation subsetting subsetI like this function a lot merging merge and reshaping statsreshapeI prefer the reshape2httpcranrprojectorgwebpackagesreshape2indexhtml package Im currently writing a texbook on data manipulation and visualization with R and I have planned to include a dedicated chapter on that topic However it is likely it will rely on base functions as well as the plyrhttpcranrprojectorgwebpackagesplyrindexhtml and HmischttpcranrprojectorgwebpackagesHmiscindexhtml packages I noticed that the author seems to make extensive use of the memischttpcranrprojectorgwebpackagesmemiscindexhtml package for codebook

statistical analysis with Stata J Scott Longhttpwwwindianaedujslsoc The workflow of data analysis using Statahttpwwwstatacombookstoreworkflowdataanalysisstata Stata Press 2009 However after having skimmed over a few random pages I feel it would apply equally to R or other software package There is a companion package that can be found by issuing stata findit workflow at Stata prompt It targets Stata 9 and 10 but it will work with Stata 12 It essentially consists in two separate packages wfpart1 and wfpart2 and a set of help files wfhelp The first two packages are dta and do files that are used throughout the book datasets and Stata commands They all goes in your home directory by default As a matter of fact everything is labelled as wf such that it is easy to move them elsewhere on your hard drive That is about 160 files in total ls wf wc l 157 About wfhelp here is a snapshot of whats going to be installed in your personal ado folder wfhelpimg20120426203907png After that you will be able to type query help for wfdata and get the screen reproduced below wfhelp2img20120426204757png I have to read the book now and I will probably update this post with a more detailed

been a pleasuring experience since I wrote this book using Emacs R and git In fact I spent several days and nights with a screen looking like the one shown below this is Homebrew Emacs in fullscreen mode Writing a book using Emacsimgemacsbookpng Of course there are many things to fix and Im not totally happy with the book as it stands I think it would have been much easier to write this book five years ago Now there are so many good books on R that it is a very challenging task to write a new one I have only one excuse This book was written for students enrolled in a course on staistical computing using R Stata and SAS Book price should not exceed 10 in electronic format so I think this is a good deal for them As discussed in this recent blog post Emacs for data sciencehttpwwwinsightdatasciencecomblogemacsfordatasciencehtml there are many editors available for various programming languages or simply for text editing In the past I often found myself lurking at other builtin editors or IDE with the hope that they could facilitate my daily work This was never the case because soon or later I realized that I was always missing some of Emacs functionalities including powerful key bindings for text manipulation and moving around text in a buffer working on multiple buffers with different mode at the same time dedicated shell buffers ESS for R processing and so much more Personally I was quite happy with a shell and R running together in Emacs To date I never see a decent text editor that offer that flexibility I cannot speak of vim since I only know two shortcuts q and dd Another nice post on writing a book using Emacs can be found on masteringemacsorghttpswwwmasteringemacsorg How to write a book in Emacshttpswwwmasteringemacsorgarticlehowtowriteabookinemacs by Mickey Petersen I doubt I will have the chance to proofread the book using ediff but at least I wont have to bother with MS Word track changes since the book was written in plain LaTeX The Wiley French template was probably written early in the 90s with no support for unicode such that I gave up using my knitr master file and rewrote everything which means converting my unicode text to Latin1 please never again and putting my R code into simple verbatim environments Note that in the mean time magithttpsgithubcommagitmagit has been updated to version 21 and it really rocks Since I update my Emacs packages from various sources including marmalade I dont necessarily rely on stable versions Here are my current settings as confirmed

Lua","tags":["apple"],"href":"/yet-another-interactive-prompt-for-calculus","content":"Here is a brief overview of how to manually install Numeric Luahttpnumlualuaforgenet on OS X I compiled Luahttpwwwluaorg 51 some months ago My header files are in usrlocal find usrlocalinclude name lua usrlocalincludeluah usrlocalincludeluahpp usrlocalincludeluaconfh usrlocalincludelualibh There exists a binary versionhttpluabinariesluaforgenet of Lua but also a Framework versionhttpwwwfrykholmseluaframeworkhtml Installation of numlua went file after some modifications for OS X The very basic instructions are cd lib make cd make sudo make install This doesnt work on OS X The standard installation instruction for a linux architecture wont work because of a number of separate issues the main critical fixes are we need to replace f77 by gfortran the lg2c flag is not appropriate with gfortran because it only works with f77 the target directory is not correctly specified The last trick is to link to the BLAS and LAPACK routines which on OS X means to link against the Accelerate frameworkhttpdeveloperapplecomperformanceaccelerateframeworkhtml1 The main steps are thus to correct the Fortran and BLASLAPACK stuff in the lib directory In particular we ask not to generate libblasa and liblapacka although I suspect using make noblas would work I was inspired by the patches available for the Macports version of numlua Here are my own patch files numluapatchtargzhttpwwwaliquoteorgpubnumluapatchtargz The problem was then that lua was not able to find luarngso which got installed in usrlocallib while default search path was usrlocalliblua51 This is because the path were not correct in the Makefile Lets go with the quick and dirty way I shall correct the Makefile later sudo mv usrlocallibluaso usrlocalliblua51 Then another problem emerged I have a 64bit lua but I compiled numlua as 32bits only So I recompiled everything removing the m32 flag when calling gcc Ok then I ran again in trouble with luaspfun require numlua gives me dlopenusrlocalliblua51luaspfunso 2 Symbol not found cdfbet However require luarng works Way cool it seems that it likely comes from the Fortran code On closer inspection it looks like theres a problem with libdcdflibcdfbetf because cdfbeto appears as MachO object i386 So the problem is that gfortran compiled everything in 32bit mode I added the m64 switch to get a MachO 64bit object x8664 Now it works except for spfun lua Lua 514 Copyright C 19942008 Luaorg PUCRio require numlua r rngostime for i15 do printrunif end 051236621534918
